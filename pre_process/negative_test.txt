<s> this movie was outright painful for me to watch i understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films but there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to first off jump cuts there are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes there are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take and the rest of the line is from a different take secondly the dialog i understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialog for their films since this film is very specific to its location the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also example set a movie in boston yet people use west coast slang with a chicago accent even with understanding this it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present these are only the two most vivid problems i encountered with this film there were a few others i do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing i have years of experience in the film more importantly the low budget indie film industry i also understand that with many directors there is often a method to their madness i have been unable to discover this method used in this film this makes it difficult when trying to decide whether i view this film as an example of unique style in film making or just another low budget poorly put together film i honestly hope that it is not the latter if anyone has any insight into why things were done a certain way or has any thoughts views of their own concerning this film i would love to hear them hopefully i can understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed </s>

<s> the recent death of stephen bach one of the producers of heaven's gate has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film moreover the original release the long version was recently shown on tcm exposing the film in ail probability to its largest audience ever br br i saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd avenue cinema across the street from bloomingdales i think it was released on a friday and withdrawn on the following wednesday maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films i am better able to articulate why br br first there is the dreaded phrase mise-en-scene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera for example a crowd extra will be given a piece of action say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from when the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action if there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action all of the extras do this then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing this is mise-en-scene in the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensional br br the importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the french critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métier-en-scene even more derogatorily referred to as a traffic cop an auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned the metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper it is the difference between say john ford and sam wood br br the second point is how the director michael cimino got into the position of directing films cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar tv commercial this depicted a chevrolet floating down the grand canal in venice this commercial never appears on any lists of greatest tv commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was the effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head cute for a three year old embarrassing for a thirty year old so cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learned br br his first film thunderbolt and lightfoot 1974 has a scene where clint eastwood and jeff bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth back and forth until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one i had the feeling that if the producer eastwood hadn't stepped in that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed br br which brings us to heaven's gate i guess if one watches the film on a dvd in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive this is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this its like sex at some point it just becomes a whipping there is the opening 40 minutes which takes place at harvard brilliantly photographed at oxford it is something of a non-sequitur i personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial now i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna tell you of most films however the whole preface adds up to only one line kris kristofferson and john hurt went to harvard together now twenty years later all of that time money and effort not to mention all of the audiences attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information br br then there's the scene in the street between kristofferson and masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information it's just so exhausting there is just one scene after another like this it's like trying to eat a thirty pound pizza then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible witless dialogue which go on and on and are exhausting and boring br br of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped it's basically painless but don't let anybody tell you it's a good film when i saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where kris kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times that's symbolic he said of he doesn't know which way to go that is basically at its kernel the basis of every pro heaven's gate critique br br watch it if you must but be forewarned this is not a film whose time has come this is a stinker which will smell for all time br br heaven's gate is historically inaccurate in the extreme i recommend the book banditti of the plains by asa mercer on the johnson county war </s>

having to direct another sequel to house party and decided to bring in a completely random formula from a funnier film and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula that was a huge mistake when a director tries to do this what eventually happens is confusion within the audience we think that we are going in one direction but instead we head in another one that is exactly what you can witness in house party 4 in one instance we have john-john trying to have the biggest party of the decade while also trying to score a record deal ok kinda reminds me of the original house party but then we whisk away to this random island where uncle charles is afraid of flying grandma gets drunk and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer again we begin somewhat strong and end chaotic this is the confusion in which i speak director stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story he would rather cut corners keep the jokes cheap and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series one would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another house party film he would walk into it thinking that he she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life instead stokes just wanted to get paid br br i realize that i am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by but i do believe i still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture i listened to rap and r b growing up but the group immature never made it to either my cassette deck or my cd player why i don't think they ever quite had a following but apparently to director chris stokes it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new house party film didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly or how about the option to have stokes himself play the comedic car repairman nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor it was one of those few instances when i actually missed robin harris and i never thought i would find myself saying that to any film outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role i also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film uncle charles was annoying when he attempted humor kim whitely was completely wasted for her scenes both literally and figuratively while well everyone else pretty much falls into that category br br where did chris stokes spend most of the budget for this film not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some there were definitely none present at the unforgettable house party nor the possible dream that perhaps kid or play would make one final appearance house party 4 followed no preset design which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver routine for humor stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance for once i can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film house party 4 buried the series and while i do hear that there may be more in the pipeline i only hope hollywood realizes that this series has died hollywood needs to let this series end forget about the past and move forward in the future i think a sequel to who's the man would get them started in the right direction br

<s> i like steve buscemi i like his work very much both as an actor and a director you could say that i am into steve buscemi a steve buscemi freak i lurv steve buscemi br br i remember when i first saw buscemi's full length directorial debut trees lounge i enjoyed the movie although it wasn't as good as it could have been it was almost there it almost scratched that itch the itch of wanting to see small movies about small people in small bars that are in small towns it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie  one that with a few tweaks could have been great but that's ok i like the movie and i've watched it more than once br br but this review is not about trees lounge it's about lonesome jim when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw who's movie it was i was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees lounge could have been but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation br br in other words this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state  the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning or if you happen to be the floozy waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich with store brand white bread no less and the emotion of a cadaver i am not sure what the point of this film was and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission sorta like those new cars that don't come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars i'm not one of them but hey i can sympathize overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film i mean trees lounge was about boring people doing boring things but it was interesting br br i blame a lot of this on affleck why do people keep casting these affleck turds they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with one affleck was in one decent film and wasn't even the reason why the film was decent and all of the sudden every butthole named affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can and liv tyler is no better being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress she is as lifeless as affleck these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma  these two duds together don't have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at wal mart i always thought that steve buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum but oh steve you let us down this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper </s>

<s> the brief existence of the sex pistols and the making of this film after the controversial groundbreaking english punk band's break-up both happened before i was born however i started listening to their only album never mind the b s here's the sex pistols in 2003 when i was a teenager and quickly became a big fan i didn't see the great rock n roll swindle until 2006 but saw it a couple times that year and thought it was pretty good certainly not great but pretty good even if i could only remember bits of it and didn't see how it all connected seeing it a third time nearly three years after the second i didn't care much for it at all i'm not even sure what i found so good about most of it in the first place can't remember now br br this film is a mockumentary in which sex pistols manager malcolm mclaren tells his side of the story of the band and its members guitarist steve jones credited here as the crook drummer paul cook credited as the tea-maker bassist sid vicious credited as the gimmick and john lydon a k a johnny rotten credited as the collaborator mclaren claims that he created the band and even the genre of punk rock as a scam to make money he tells much of the story to helen wellington-lloyd a k a helen of troy in various places where they go together it's basically a hodgepodge of mclaren talking pistols songs live footage of the band fictional scenes often silly strange ones several cartoon sequences etc all put together in one film to tell the pistols manager's side of the story in a bizarre way br br it has been well proved that mclaren is a liar i know many have already pointed this out including band members themselves he was not the driving force of the band he didn't create them nor did he invent punk rock and the sex pistols weren't even the first punk band though they were unique the band members were the ones who made the band what it was the filth and the fury a much more believable film about the band from julien temple who made this film is told from the point of view of the band members who contradict mclaren's claims however the dishonesty of the great rock n roll swindle is not my biggest problem with it if it were actually entertaining which i used to think it was to a certain extent i would be able to overlook that like i obviously used to be able to do during my third viewing apart from sex pistols songs some live footage and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence it was pretty dull i found the who killed bambi song mildly amusing at first but it got tiring very quickly br br is this mockumentary worth watching for sex pistols fans it seems a good number of fans would say it is not to learn about the true story of the short-lived but groundbreaking 70's punk band but for entertainment that was once my opinion on the great rock n roll swindle after the first time i watched it i couldn't remember a thing mclaren said and by the time i saw it the second time i was aware of what the pistols manager was using this film to imply but could still barely remember anything i heard him say obviously other aspects of the film were what i found impressive now after my third viewing i can definitely remember some of the things mclaren says but it still wasn't 100 clear like most of the film i guess his words are not that memorable probably because of the way they're presented if you're a pistols fan i guess it wouldn't hurt to give swindle a try but to me for the most part it's just an incoherent boring mess that tries to be funny but fails </s>
<s> all i could think while watching this movie was will it ever end it was unbearably boring to watch i was wishing i could just turn it off but i wanted to do this review justice so i fought the good fight and withstood the torture of watching this movie all the way through so that you the good reader need not bear that pain also br br this movie sounds like it has a great premise if you read the premise on paper however the actual movie does not deliver on this premise at all br br the opening scene features a mineshaft in the early 1900's where they are forcing kids to carry dynamite into the tunnels that aren't big enough for the adults to fit into this seems to be setting up the premise for an interesting movie but after 4 minutes it becomes clear that is not the case the adults who committed these crimes are never punished there is no consequences shown in the movie for their actions the opening scene is way better than and completely irrelevant to the rest of the movie the last time an opening scene misrepresented a movie so grievously was the opening scene of 28 days later which was the only good scene in that whole movie wicked little things zombies a movie so crappy they changed the title to try to disguise it's crappiness and sell it again is exactly the same in this regard the opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie br br instead the movie flashes forward to present-day a single mother and her two bratty foul-mouthed kids right here is when it would have been wise to press the stop button and never go near the movie again br br in the first hour the zombie kids are barely even seen they get maybe 3 minutes of screen-time total all they do is kill a pig that's it the rest of the hour is spent showing the dumb mother and her dumb kids buy things at the local store wander around the forest and have inane conversations with each other the dumb teenage daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and smokes weed with them br br there would be no reason to care at all if the zombie kids dispatched anyone in this movie every single character is both dumb annoying with no redeeming qualities at all not to mention one-dimensional and clichéd br br this movie would have been vastly improved if the mother and her dumb kids were dispatched in the first 10 minutes by the zombie kids as they were driving up to their new house then the end credits rolled that right there would instantly change the score from 1 10 to 10 10 honestly when the dumb mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road her daughter scolds her you almost killed us mom of course anyone with common sense knows that if the mom had hit the pedestrian it would be the pedestrian who would be dead  not the people safely encased inside the car i guess this line was put into the movie to show firsthand that the utter stupidity of the main characters knows no bounds and runs in the family br br wicked little things zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes but it definitely felt like 5 hours or more to me trying to not fall asleep was a tremendous challenge it's not until over an hour has passed into the 1 hour and 34 minutes that the zombie children actually bother to kill any person then the scene shows the dumb teenagers drinking beer and making out in a car and saying lines like if you ever wanna get in my pants again you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now seriously that's verbatim from the movie the teenagers are so clichéd one-dimensional badly-acted dumb annoying that when the zombie kids finally get around to hacking 3 of them up 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie it feels like a cause for celebration of course the princess dumb weed-smoking foul-mouthed beer-drinking loser daughter of the main mother character gets away scott-free what a buzzkill that was she was on the screen longer than the others and hence the most annoying of the 4 of them and most deserving of a pickaxe to the head all the more reason why she should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes as aforementioned to still keep her around past 1 hour and 5 minutes though is totally inexcusable br br the reason for this of course is that feature length movies need to be padded to at least 1 hour and 30 minutes so by keeping her alive long-past when she should be they have an extra 27 minutes to pad the movie with her and her mother running through the woods by 1 hour and 22 minutes in it's the second time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine won't start whilst the zombie kids are coming to get her br br the zombie kids are completely generic never say anything no character development at all for any of them br br in the end all 3 of the annoying idiotic main characters live which in my opinion is the filmmakers way of giving a final flipping the bird gesture to the viewing audience in my opinion the filmmakers surely know that they have bamboozled anyone who has had the great misfortune to watch the whole movie why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes die br br avoid wicked little things zombies like the bubonic plague </s>

<s> it's about jealousy it's about racism it's about manipulation but the underlying message is love geoffrey sax tried to pull off shakespeare's othello by bringing it to modern day context however the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective however john othello played by eamonn walker over reacted a lot in this film causing for the down fall of keeley hawes dessie brabant eventually ending in dessie's death br br ben jago played by christopher eccleston was seen as the main character in the film he didn't give enough evidence for dessie to be cheating on othello with michael cass played by richard coyle instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she was cheating in the play it took a lot more convincing from iago to make othello even suspect anything this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons than what the book was based off of however the movie did have a few good points it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks where othello is the main chief of the police squad these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds and burning fires you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie more so than you can in the book this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand than the shakespearian times it was written in in the play iago jago gets tortured at the end but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets othello's position he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late i saw this as a downfall in the movie because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying and in the book he is found out by rodrigo overall the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow or make it more of a tragedy i would say that you should read the book first in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie otherwise you may find yourself lost and confused </s>

<s> here's why this movie fell very short of its potential i don't read much so i don't care what the novel was like 1 i think brendan frasier copied his encino man from lambert's tarzan it was stiff and while his tarzan call was a little more realistic he had no humanity 2 they screwed with the story maybe that's how the book goes but for as long as i can remember the first utterances of tarzan were me tarzan you jane jane is the first human tarzan encounters i did like the natives a bit more than the shoepolished midget pigmys in weismuller's version but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy 3 tarzan is primarily a love story i'm sorry but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture that qualifies her for a supporting role at best supporting roles and leads don't fall for each other not enough screen time sorry not only was andie mcdowell's vioce over pathetic most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked the chemistry scale between tarzan and jane was a whopping 0 i never believed they loved each other which made the belgian dudes closing voice over quite frankly silly when tarzan sees jane for the first time in the jungle he feels an urge if you will a feeling he's never felt before jane brings out the humanity in him and he brings out the untamed side of her its this chemistry that compells the story of tarzan not that lord greystoke's dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him even a good face lift couldn't help this movie it needs massive internal reconstruction oh and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place final judgement 4 out of 10 sorry tin-man and by the way if you want to see real acting drop lambert and check out leonardo dicaprio </s>

<s> i had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing but i just found it annoying it's been a while since i've seen it and hopefully i won't find out all my memories are wrong and i'm unjustly condemning this movie but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray leopold and loeb as victimized by an anti-gay society and that this somehow caused their horrible crime i totally disagree with this point of view and think it's unfair both to homosexuals and to bobby franks the real victim of the story i can't imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as martyrs i also thought l l were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually were--after all they were teenagers who lived at home the film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems like it should be scored by morrissey br br i just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that implied the film's anachronisms such as the push-button phones that characters used were meant to add brechtian distance they certainly do that but i happened to find it highly irksome br br apparently a number of people found this movie interesting but i would have preferred a less stylish and more realistic examination of the part homosexuality may have played in the leopold loeb case </s>

<s> i went to see random hearts with 3 friends and at first i thought maybe it was just me who wasn't enjoying the movie after all i didn't like as good as it gets and that movie won all sorts of awards well it wasn't just me none of my friends liked it either it was unbelievable slow much like getting teeth pulled the only action that is in the movie is what is in previews we didn't walk out of the theatre because we all assumed something more would happen we weren't as smart as the 7 or 8 people who did walk out i have never walked out on a movie in my life but i definitely should have this is all tough for me to write considering i am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies it takes a lot for me to think a movie is awesome but not much for me to just like it this movie didn't even come close in the like category not only was the movie about 2 hours too long but it was like two separate trite stories in one but they weren't smoothly sewn together plus the soundtrack if you could even call it that was so annoying like seinfeld has the same riff that is played over and over again difference being that i like seinfeld this movie had this jazz riff that it kept playing which sounded highly inappropriate at times especially when people were dealing with the deaths of the plane crash hard to explain what i mean but trust me it was awful i cannot say enough to make people not waste their money after i left the theatre i honestly wanted to write to the movie company and demand my 7 back sheeesh i could have gone bowling or something for that money </s>

<s> i want to say i liked this film i really do but when it boils down to it it was just far too boring it starts off looking promising and even once they get inside the mines the creepy atmosphere and mood is great the problem is the monster or lack of it as people have said it's a stop-motion monster but that's not the problem stop-motion can look great if done properly the problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't get to see any deaths this is meant to be a horror film so a lack of monster and a lack of deaths equals boredom there were some scenes i liked such as when one girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming towards her there are also a few other creepy scenes but they are far too few to hold your interest and definitely not worth watching the film for it's a shame because i can see that had it been handled correctly it would've been an effectively creepy horror flick the saddest thing is that films like this will never be made again because film makers over-polish their films these days and rely on crappy cgi effects </s>

<s> i recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is chuck norris this meant that i would have to do extensive chuck research and find out as much as i could about the man i later find out that he is not in fact a man but an angel sent from heaven with a face like that who could ever doubt it i have watched more chuck norris movies in the last four months than any one person should i am proud to say that bells of innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list i spent most of the film wondering if i could return my copy to the local wal-mart without the receipt which i had been biting down on to keep myself from swallowing my own tongue the biggest reason why i chose to purchase this film was that it not only had chuck in it but his son mike i was anxious to see if mike was a chip off the old can't-act-his-way-out-of-a-wet-paper-bag block i came to the conclusion a long while ago the chuck norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason the only character he ever plays is himself chuck norris no matter what movie no matter what situation he is always chuck norris the one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work in the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter he seems to be extremely happy maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic as depicted in one of the oddest flashbacks of all time his actions confused me throughout the film making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was the other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of norris the guy who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the direct-to-video screen the only thing i remember him being in other than this movie was an episode of walker texas ranger in which he plays an equally annoying character maybe chuck owes this guy something the other guy which is the only name i can think of because he was so forgettable was your average christian fanatic i don't have anything against christians in fact i am one but this guy was just too much for me to round out the story you have a multitude of townspeople who love to call people friend and a couple of villains who don't seem to be able to decide which one of them is in charge not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies all in all the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time on more levels than chuck norris can kick people's asses despite being one of the worst actors of all time i still can't get enough of chuck maybe he really was sent from heaven </s>

<s> yet again i appear to be the only person on planet earth who is capable of criticizing japanese films made before 1970 fires on the plain 1959 is another in the seemingly endless line of classics that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason as much as i love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film it's still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of masterpiece what i find truly ironic is that fans of derivative classics like fires on the plain focus so much on inside the box movie-making orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting acting camera-work etc yet it always seems like the most highly revered classics are most deficient in these very standards for example one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial most surprisingly the very first scene in fires on the plain uses this indolent tactic to the extreme br br after a funny head slap the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer why can't you grasp the situation we landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at tacloban we lost two-thirds of our men our artillery was sunk in transit we tried to reach burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible the enemy's counterattack forced a fanout across the valley you know that so why exactly is one character telling another character something he already knows oh yeah that's right the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information you see a quality film would actually show these events happening or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events heck even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here br br such instances of poor quality movie-making are littered throughout fires on the plain to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles for example the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in japanese garb instead of doing the natural thing like  oh i don't know  giving a depressed mannerism the character blurts out japanese soldiers thanks buddy but i could have figured that one out for myself br br even worse this movie is saturated with over-dramatic ploys the most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots picture this a soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots one would think that such a find is utterly useless but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his super worn boots behind fine i get the point the soldiers are in rough shape  a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with the scene is ridiculous but i was ready to let it go until the second soldier arrives you see he finds the previous soldier's super worn boots and notices  get ready cause here it comes  that his boots are super duper worn boots lucky man he picks up the super worn boots and leaves his super duper worn boots behind but you see that's not all  because the third soldier then arrives he finds the previous soldiers super duper worn boots and inspects them along with his own super duper worn boots since both pairs suck he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot at this point i was ready to throw my television through my living room window the heavy handedness overdramaticism and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film-making it's super duper bad film-making br br there are a number of similar completely stupid moments to be had like the time when the lead character asks someone hey are you dead like the guy is going to answer yes if he actually kicked the bucket i'll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction i laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid goofy expression on his face br br the fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an imdb average rating of 8 4 while a certifiable masterpiece like a tale of two sisters 2003 only gets a 7 5 is the height of mass stupidity and to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that atots doesn't make sense well not every movie can have completely outrageous super duper worn boots on its side </s>

<s> there's something going on in this film directed by x-files scribe john shiban that has eluded me you get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems yet i feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward it's about perception there are characters the heroine nicole jaimie alexander meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish this might seem like a spoiler but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers part they seem to be poking fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what nicole is seeing or not it never gets a proper answer and i for one was a bit clueless at the point there comes a time in a film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild goose chase that ends at a dead end with little explanation at what we just saw it ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of a thrilling psycho-drama now there's nothing wrong with ambiguity itself but give us something to latch onto or you will evade us that's how i felt as i watched rest stop this film is supposedly about a young woman named nicole who decides to run off to california with lover jesse joey mendicino to make it big in hollywood they make what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so that nicole can pee but it descends into terror for her when she finds that her jesse is completely missing someone in a crusty dusty yellow truck is a nut job who seems to be causing a lot of trouble to nicole and we soon realize that he is behind jesse's disappearance when things start to occur signs provided to her if you will she will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can be br br that's the easy part when a female character comes into play the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from how she got there and more importantly where she goes once nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the restroom's utilities cabinet she meets another a police officer in the area joey lawrence who might seem like her savior but when he too is a victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with the truck driver commits torturous acts to nicole like holing her up in the restroom and as she tries to untie a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock she receives a nasty bite from him he then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without a lasting place of refuge from the beast br br it's the timing of the truck driver's attacks that has me listless perhaps he just likes tormenting her but he appropriately appears in certain situations where nicole has time to flee or prepare it doesn't make much sense his motives which propel the film into an illogical idea why does he make himself so obvious why does he allow her to prepare it seems i'm going out on a limb here that he likes having his quarry believe they can find a way of escape only to stomp that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack yet why does shiban decide to play with the viewer by having nicole experience odd meetings with people that don't exist what is shiban and the writing team trying to say and to cap off the film's unhinged weirdness is a family in a rv they play a small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves but the film doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all </s>

<s> in the 1930s hal roach studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as laurel and hardy charley chase and the little rascals most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time however a lesser-known roach product was the pairing of thelma todd and zasu pitts later todd was paired with the equally untalented patsy kelly try as i might i just can't stand these pictures--they just aren't funny plus unlike laurel and hardy there was not an ounce of chemistry between todd and her two co-stars before you just think i am a crank understand that i have seen and reviewed several hundred roach films as well as many other early comedies so i am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre this team is among the worst part of the reason i think i am right about the team is that as a lower-tier team at roach they were given all the scripts no one else wanted if stan or ollie hated a given plot idea it was often given to todd and pitts kelly--and usually it showed br br in this film however the team is at their absolute lowest it's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot the film begins with zasu in the jury and thelma as a defense lawyer as for zasu she's a completely annoying moron not the lovable type moron like stan laurel or lou costello but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious as for thelma as usual she's the rather bland straight man and as such has little to do but react to zasu's boorish behavior br br the plot involves thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills considering that the pills are highly dangerous when the attorney asks zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb and while they were called pills they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense--even for a low-brow comedy when they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends br br as i said i am not a fan of this team however even for those who want to like the film there isn't one legitimate laugh in the entire short when i talked over this review with my wife who also saw the movie with me she thought my score of 2 was overly generous </s>

<s> let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover with that said anyone who says this is the worst film ever is being dramatic and anyone who says that the film is great is completely delusional the film is what it is and what is that a modest budget 4 million i estimate studio sequel the film isn't terrible but for road house fans it will be a disappointment and that brings me to problem one just as dirty dancing wouldn't been what it was without swayze road house isn't the same without him the lead lacks depth character and likability to carry the film i feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel the other cast was uneven with outstanding actors like will patton along side day players who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag busey who i have seen do great characters seemed like he just mailed it in ellen was played well except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick sherri the dea agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped the writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters instead opting for a base one dimensional film which leads me to the biggest problem the script i got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an and and an it looked very amateur and that is what the writing was i heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core sucking began some cheezy parts of the film to watch for are during the first undercover meeting the obvious drug deal under the table hey lets meet at a crowded nudey bar i will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table wait make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking second i love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a lark 10 minutes later there are some nasty editing cuts towards the end of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron which brings me to the realism of the dea training i won't both to get technical but jumping thru doors isn't standard training nor do typical female agents who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field act like weak characters boring thanks for the chauvinistic view heir director there is other stuff i could teach a course at a school about it the sped up fighting the cheezy dialogue the recycled story etc but aside from all that you just cannot like ex-mr applegate he totally lacks the humble zen coolness that made mr patrick swayze such a bad ass he just strikes me as one of those 5 foot nothing actors who think they are a bad ass but just like van damnit he runs into a real bad ass chuck zito in van don't case and he gives him a lesson about badassdom therefore that i feel is the major linchpin of the film if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass you don't have to try example swayze if you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things then well you are why your audience the average joe will not rent this film and if they do they will write reviews like this </s>

<s> i'm a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom wilkinson normal and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett dellamorte dellamore in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich lord are spot-on and entertaining but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone the music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice too bad br br i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and vice-versa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception for example watson's character while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to grate on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of permission no apologies offered and i went from disliking wilkinson's control freak moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife br br this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car the lord's dog the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for florence nightingale incarnate etc was ok until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby good god if you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach br br look everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was instead he acted like an abused dog his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him i'm not anti pc or anything it just didn't ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face the ending for me was and not the director's intention i am certain depressing the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing i'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed is that asking too much br br my score 4 10 </s>

<s> it's not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre a movie can be bad in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour bizarre characters etc a case in point are a great number of horror sci-fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era they are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their badness is entertaining however this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the piranha 1978 original br br i suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum now in the mid-2000s with the c s i shows tv's an absolute blood-fest good for us horror fans br br william katt and alexandra paul are no bradford dillman and heather menzies the original 1978 stars it's not katt's and paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie i won't say how because that is part of the plot br br this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror as can be seen from the user votes here stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie </s>
<s> my first impression when i read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very very different from the book the movie trailer said that the movie is supposed to take place when vivian is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in america she meets aiden an aspiring graphic novelist working in a chocolate shop in the day she must accept that she will never be normal because every full moon she becomes a loup-garou--a thought-to-be mythical creature that can be closely compared to a werewolf br br most of the little changes didn't sound too bad to me even though i am a fan of the book with the shared titled by annette curtis klause i knew it would be different but i wanted to see it to support the book thinking that an age change a setting change and a few little occupation changes wouldn't impact the storyline as a whole enough to make me want to tear my eyes out of their sockets and leave myself bleeding on the movie theatre ground br br the movie unnecessarily killed off many important characters one being esme vivan's mother right off the bat in the fire that was supposed to have killed her father i pushed that aside and ventured forth into the movie weary and slightly annoyed running through romania the camera angles were decent the scenery was beautiful and the music was interesting but it left me with the impression of why does vivian look like that and why is she wearing a hoodie jumping to later parts of the movie i must say that i am surprised that the screenplay writers seemed to support incest in a way and rather than sticking to the character relationship from the book between vivian and rafe the leader of the five now became her cousin through her surprise aunt astrid who in the novel was the bitter and hated rival of vivan's mother and might i add no way related to either of them br br to top off character distortions gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and obsessed over vivian being his mate so they could fulfill some nonexistent prophecy not only did his physical appearance take a complete 180 from the description in the book he was apparently also the father of rafe yes that's right it's a nice little incestuous knot of wolfies all bundled up tight br br little things that irked me were scenes like the forest hunts there was a red-head that stood out from the rest of the crowd the one who kissed their enemy before their prey was set free to run and be hunted why was she there why did she look like astrid i suppose my mind is not vast enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without any explanation as to why she existed other than to kiss pretty victims br br i loved how the amoeba was completely cut out of the movie i loved how legally entwined aiden's past was what between the supposedly dramatic scene where he was telling vivian about how his father wanted him to learn self-defense and then beat his father up in self-defense to make him seem like such a tragic character br br character 180s are a lot of fun when they are completely unnecessary at the end of the movie i felt as if some person skimmed over the novel scribbled down half the list of character names drew a few connections here and there mentioned that gabriel was a bit of a jerk vivian fell in love with aiden he fears her when he finds out she is a loup-garou of the legends and somebody is killed by a silver bullet and there is some sort of happy ending because vivian finally feels accepted by somebody who loves her for who she is br br i gave this movie a 2 10 because the camera shots were relatively decent and the casting could have been worse but as far as directing goes why do the loup-garous leap into the air in human form as if they want to fly with their arched backs and penchant to leap from high places shimmer briefly and then fall onto the ground as wolves the only aspects of this movie that even had me watch it through to the very-sordid sorry ending were the wolves the beautiful scenery and the eye-candy boys br br all-together i must say that in order to enjoy this film at all one must be ready for misconceptions strange happenings that are not always explained incestuous innuendos and have either not liked the book or have not read the book </s>

<s> this film was not all that bad as the story went but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch i just don't like that so-called realistic camera work that is being done nowadays you know the type jumping off center panning around etc what got me particularly irritated about this film though was the new thing that they threw into the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene i believe that the film would have been much better if the camera work was shot in the much more conventional way because as it was i couldn't concentrate on it and found myself analyzing the camera work instead maybe if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work like this the filmmakers will finally get the hint </s>

<s> the star packer is one of about 152 000 000 westerns that john wayne acted in during the 1930s well the number is a bit exaggerated but it seemed almost like this many this is because these b-movies were quickly made with very low budgets in order to be the second or lesser feature in a theater most bs were pretty cheap and tended to cut corners to keep down costs and the star packer is no exception to save on costs incidental music is not used running times were kept to under an hour the writing was often rather derivative and the actors are mostly lesser talents--and wayne himself was definitely far from being a household name at this time some of these wayne features are pretty good while others like this one are watchable but also rather silly and inconsequential i enjoyed this film and most of the others but it's probably because i cut bs a lot of slack br br wayne stars as john travers--a us marshall investigating the actions of a local gang out to chase locals out and steal from the stage this is odd as the film was apparently set in the modern time or close to it as they used telephones and modern machine guns--things you just wouldn't expect to find in the old west such anachronisms are actually pretty common in b westerns--as gene autry films for example abound with them wayne's sidekick is yak--played by stuntman and real life friend of wayne yakima canutt br br the bad guy is an unknown figure referred to as the shadow and he dispenses his instructions through a black screen that hides his face this sounds exactly like a character from a movie serial--the sort of baddie that kids loved but grownups groaned at because they were so silly and at bit like blofeld or dr evil the problem is if you listen to his voice and pay any attention at all it becomes obvious early in the film that this shadow is george hayes now speaking of hayes this is the same guy who later in films was known as gabby hayes but here and in several other of wayne's early films he looks and acts nothing like gabby in the star packer he was well dressed articulate and clean-shaven--imagine that in real life apparently this was more the real george hayes--though i doubt that he was evil now as you can tell from the last paragraph that there really is no mystery in this film you are left with acting passable and nothing more and stunts--which were actually pretty amazing again and again one amazing stunt after another occurred--such as men jumping from horse to horse and some great fight scenes--all done by the way by canutt and his friends canutt was often john wayne's double in films--and this went on for decades the problem with some of the stunts however is that it appears that the film makers actually killed a few horses to get those great stumbling horses bits seen later in the film up until about 1940 film makers often strung thin metal wire and ran horses across it at full gallop in the process the horses legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently euthanized one of the worst examples of this was the film jesse james--where several horses were brutally killed--leading to the american humane association insisting that a representative of the organization be on film shoots to certify that animals are not hurt in the production so since about 1940 films bear this little disclaimer the star packer was made well before the disclaimer and i can't see how the horses did these tricks without being killed br br overall this is at best a time-passer due to a poor plot occasionally poor acting and an unbelievable cruel attitude towards the horses i am no bleeding heart but just can't understand this disregard for a poor old animal </s>

<s> during production this lwt series was titled rocket to the moon a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough then word came through that it had been retitled reach for the moon as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters this same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series and the same tired and boring love-triangle storyline is actually stretched out over 7 episodes any television program that decides to use the love-triangle storyline for even a single episode is pushing it but to smear it over seven episodes is unforgivable there are reasons to watch however with the scenery of the isle of wight certainly providing a beautiful setting and the seemingly effortless performance of lynda bellingham hitting all the right comedy marks this however is not enough a number of performances are noticeable especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland which jonathan kerrigan refers to as his face i have already mentioned lynda bellingham in the role of fussy mother yes thats as far as character development and back-story goes but i was impressed by the actor maurice roeves who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast having appeared in everything from classic movies such as richard attenborough's oh what a lovely war and the eagle has landed and tv including baywatch holby city the bill eastenders cheers doctor who in the 80s star trek and even going to hollywood with sylvestor stallone in 1995s judge dredd whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers i have met  often incapable men whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak it is refreshing to see that roeves is still getting work having also appeared in the 1998 british film the acid house and even more recently alongside the wonderful maria bello and sean bean in the dark the standout reason to watch this series even though his appearances are very few another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program is ben miles in the role of the sex-mad typical man brother once again what an original character as with roeves the cv says it all after elevating this miles has since appeared in the hollywood movie v for vendetta and the 2001 star studded film the affair of the necklace alongside brian cox adrien brody christopher walken and jonathan pryce unfortunately the fairly capable actors i have mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic driftwood that is kerrigan and saira todd both of whom seem to have been in casualty for too long and haven't yet learned to act even the tolerable frances grey is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins and unfortunately for her the lasting memory i have of her from the set is of the ad asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take she subconsciously pulled her knickers out of her crack  familiar faces appear in each episode  child actors from cbbc programs and dramas such as 2 point 4 children and other regulars from commercials such as mr ben's they'll remember me for this lynda the oxo lady bellingham and others that i don't even want to remember each episode halfheartedly tries to deal with issues such as teenage pregnancy disruptive pupils and rocket building things that grange hill was doing better when my parents were young overall this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series unfortunately for them they took the easy route both in the writing and for the most part in the casting i would recommend both waterloo road and the street to fans of good drama  the latter in particular which managed to achieve this if you like the isle of wight don't reach for the moon reach for the holiday brochure instead  it probably contains more character development </s>

<s> aside from the gunfight scene i felt the movie was a waste of celluloid robert duvall kevin costner and annette bening could have played those roles in their sleep the dialog was marginally tolerable and there was plenty of it--no one sat together quietly in this movie the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes to cram into the story there was no subtlety at all--foreshadowing hit you between the eyes and they led you by the nose through most of the story i think they added all the dialog to make sure you didn't miss anything and the editing really needed tightening up each actor's screen time was more quantity than quality--again too much dialog br br the entire story took place over the course of a few days but everything that happened took on epic proportions much like how day-to-day happenings seemed huge to you in high school but in the grand scheme really weren't that important yes the bad guys beat up and killed mose they beat up button they killed the dog--all things which would get boss and charley's blood up but the importance was diluted by all of the deep meaningful conversations which dominated most of the movie these guys worked together for 10 years and they're just now talking about this stuff the only time there wasn't much dialog was in the gunfight scene--which is probably why i liked it br br finally someone give annette bening a hairbrush the wispy strands of hair around her face that were i suppose to make her look a bit more romantic actually made her look a little deranged if she worked outside the home it would have made more sense plus why wasn't she married already there seemed to be several kind and gentle her words single men in town aside from the marshal and his cronies in fact none of the bad guys seemed to want her either a usual plot device in other movies she stayed cooped up in the house most of the time and really didn't seem to have much connection to the people in town makes you wonder br br in all the movie was entirely too long too chatty and too contrived for me it felt like a star vehicle with lots of screen time for the big stars but not enough character depth to interest me despite all of the dialog </s>
