<s> looking back on jim henson's works years after his death is like taking a look back into another time for unlike most so-called creative types attempting to sell to or worse yet cynically exploit children nowadays jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child and if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this labyrinth aside it is 1979's muppet movie filmed as an allegorical story about how henson came to work in children's television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half-hour show of his own on primetime television the muppet movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s and as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of the muppet show is on offer here i have said it in other comments but i must say it here a great light in the world went out the day jim henson died br br the muppet movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes in short precise strokes we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors and when the story proper begins boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment the rainbow connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the muppets especially kermit were these were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show they were living things based upon a part of all of us only writ so much more boldly than we are used to as each muppet was introduced to us in turn we saw another reflection of part of ourselves and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character hence everyone had a favourite when animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal i knew i had found one of mine nowadays i am more of a swedish chef fan but what the hey br br complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities can you picture that shared an insight into dr teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of henson but the most relevant song to me was gonzo's number asking what he is and where he came from many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and like gonzo saying we knew we would be going back there someday not that all the songs were so deadly serious of course fozzy and kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent or lack thereof and hit the road if any evidence were required that present-day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable this number would be it never before and never again would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another with the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game the human cast had a lot to live up to br br which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal cameos literally pepper the film with everyone from steve martin to telly savalas popping in to offer their support even richard pryor the last man one would expect to see in a film about the muppets appears to set up a hilarious moment mel brooks cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when i was a small boy but i suspect that is because henson knew why i would find it disturbing now the big acting strength though comes from charles durning who as doc hopper embodies everything both henson and his audience determined to resist at every junction hopper comes to either offer kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind or perhaps offer stops being the right word when hopper's attempts to ensure kermit's compliance become progressively more forceful and violent the whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the world br br of course animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend in point of fact animal turns out to be the best friend that kermit has in that moment and that has been the core message of every good show or film henson has been involved in ever since that shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes there can be little doubt that in today's world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities henson's creature workshop could never have got off the ground to misquote the album title daring to be stupid is one thing but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter the muppet movie demonstrates how henson dared to ask us all to think both inside and outside of the proverbial box there will never be another entirely like him but he never would want us to stop trying br br therefore the muppet movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film if we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated this would be it </s>

<s> spoilers ahead br br 15 park avenue my humble take on this film br br now for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine niche films like 15 park avenue ought to be palatable to my sensibilities with this thought and a mild sense of embarrassment that i hadn't watched the complete film earlier i watched this film last saturday there are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary mulholland drive david lynch from which this film borrows at least 3 concepts  br br a that at least some truths are relative b the first scene of shabana and konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll is uncannily similar to the car ride that betty and rita undertook in mulholland drive in both cases the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in aparna's film c the incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole occurence behind winkies involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that something as well as the character per se is seamlessly linked to other works of lynch notice carefully the disheveled long hair the effect of the beggar woman in 15 pa appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message br br the other films from which 15 pa also borrows is blow up especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth vs perceived truth poser presented towards the end of antonioni's masterpiece of course the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind a beautiful mind although admittedly the subject here is high brow physics and shabana who professes it inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of konkona's character through those very prophecies in an outstanding scene in the movie some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the real world of shabana where quantum physics and the theory of relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe to the artificial edifice of the make believe world of mithi but for all their differences the sisters are alike too both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships one out of choice and the other out of nature so mithi's pain at being rejected in love by joydeep is in harmony with the inability of shaban to form a special bond with either kunal dhritiman or sanjeev kanwaljeet but i'm getting ahead of myself viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways  br br hypothesis 1 it was shabana all along there is a certain section of the audience who think so but that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too i e all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing mithi along with her br br hypothesis 2 there was a real mithi and the ending is a metaphor this pov says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film when in response to a statement by joy rahul bose that mithi is looking for something that she will never find his wife laxmi shefali shah philosophizes that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia the end of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment br br there are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by our knowledgeable audience like  br br hypothesis 3 shabana and konkona are alter egos of the same person hypothesis 4 shabana too is a figment of mithi's imagination hypothesis 5 the old haggard perhaps mad beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story br br are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested well your guess is as good as mine br br why 15 park avenue contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the park avenue in ny i believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap remember her stating jo jo's profession as prime minister of shikakai which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing shampoos the prefix 15 is used as it was on 15th december that mithi got engaged to joydeep and after his walkout she remains forever in a time warp the film has its fair share of flaws lack of use of a strong background score which in films like these can really augment the narrative some sloppy dialogs unabated by some forced dialog delivery inconsistent performances shabana and dhritimaan are excellent though imo by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted shefali chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot i give it 7 10 as it made me think but not any higher than that because i can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced and for the most part thoroughly enjoyed those previously i have already thought on similar lines earlier so the experience post 15 pa is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty where am i coming from i

<s> this has been edited for space br br chan-wook park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify nominally a horror movie the central character is a vampire the film actually has elements of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion and its analog of viral invasion of a body romance and few other things as well it's a film that has almost too much on its mind the film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic european literature in this case emile zola's thérèse raquin it's an odd mix that doesn't always gel but none the less has an incredible power here it is almost 24 hours since i saw the film at lincoln center with a post film discussion by the director and i find my cage is increasingly rattled its not so much what happens is bothersome its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect br br the plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood its not explained he actually survives hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick unfortunately all is not well the priest finds that he needs blood to survive he also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire and its no not possible for him to go out during the day things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family the priest some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend from there it all goes sideways br br an ever changing film this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was it's a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways br br the film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the film br br the two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance the vampire part of the tale is brilliant there is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside sitting in the theater last night i found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked i think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life it's contrasted with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn't going to work its not the dark world of twilight or lost boys rather its something else i personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible the sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool the romance is also wonderfully handled sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but it's the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special i love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible consummation this is one of the great screen romances of all time it perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love and lust if you've ever loved deeply i'm guessing you'll find some part of your hear on screen i know i did the statement i just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad poignancy to it it's both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion the tragic romance will break your heart br br i won't lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great especially the actors who i have unjustly failed to hail as amazing the whole doesn't always come together the various genres thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other frequently i was wondering where the film was going i hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly br br i liked the film a great deal i loved the pieces more than the film as a whole its been pinging around in my head since i saw it and i'm guessing that it will do so for several days more like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward one of the meatiest and most filling films of the year </s>

<s> now i do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some indians have concerning their women and sexuality i have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society with women being murdered because the husband's family doesn't want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing i also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter--even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in india a decade ago as a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie most western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film br br although i am a male am not rabidly feminist and i am straight the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is not an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and man haters in fact i don't think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands yes i use the word wicked and mean it as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses sexuality in many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence br br one husband married a vivacious young woman sita out of family obligation this arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband however he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about sita--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded chinese lady to make matters worse he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies in their dead marriage sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met and unfortunately he could have cared less br br another husband was married to a lady who was infertile radha oddly after initially trying to have children they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever it's because this man has decided to become an ascetic i e in hinduism a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment now his wanting to do this was all well and good if he was not already married and had obligations for his wife however being married this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care the closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him--as having her next to him helped teach himself to overcome the desires of the flesh this must have brought nothing but frustration to her br br so you've got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs eventually these needs bring these sister-in-laws together--at first just emotionally but later sexually as well the movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation br br late in the film when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from radha's enlightened husband--a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossible br br this is a very challenging and adult film while there is very little nudity the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady--as i said this is not a film to let your kids watch however for a mature audience this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to think br br the film features good acting complex characters excellent writing lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some but which i found rewarding the only serious negative i cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape this is because although the movie is in english the accents are quite strong at times and it's not always easy to understand what's being said but and this is the worst part there are no closed or open captions--including them is a must for western audiences if you do watch this film see if you can find it on dvd or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning--mine sure didn't br br by the way director deepa mehta a popular female director has made several other wonderful films such as earth and bollywood hollywood a consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional indian culture and expectations and westernism--with a strong emphasis on female characters not surprisingly this west-thinking lady makes her home in canada and is divorced--a truly unusual woman to say the least for a similar film that explores traditional culture meets western culture try another canadian gem eat drink man woman

<s> well sadly i can't help but feeling a little bit disappointed after my much much much-anticipated viewing of just before dawn jeff lieberman is a terrific filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things with a tiny budget but i nevertheless expected to see a far more sadistic and gruesome early 80's slasher but actually i'm beginning to think that lieberman isn't the one to blame for this but we gorehounds are it's more than obvious that lieberman intended to make his take on the backwoods-slasher look like deliverance and absolutely not like friday the 13th which immensely popularized the sub genre one year earlier the horror and constant sensation of menace doesn't mainly come from the demented maniacs with their machetes but from the genuinely ominous and isolated oregon forests where this movie was shot in case the film seems slow and uneventful this is only because lieberman takes his time to introduce the dark woods and eerie mountains as extra characters in his film we hardly ever see the killers in person but there always appears to be someone luring from behind the trees or from underneath the mountain lakes bearing this in mind just before dawn becomes a highly admirable horror effort and actually a lot better than its contemporary blood-soaked colleagues amidst a nearly endless selection of gory and sickening slashers lieberman successfully puts the emphasis back on tension and character development the plot revolves on five twenty-something friends heading for a camping vacation in the oregon woods where one of them owns a small piece of land the woods are deserted and naturally the campers ignore forest ranger roy's george kennedy advise to return back to civilization shortly after they brutally encounter an inbred family of which the twin sons have murderous tendencies all five main characters are surprisingly likable and convincing no irritating stereotypes for which you don't feel sympathy anyway like slutty girls or football jocks as a result of this natural character you automatically cheer for them even when they eventually almost turn into savages themselves the sublime camera-work supplies the film with an at times unbearable tension level and brad fiedel's chilling electronic score only adds to this effect just before dawn is a fine slice of early 80's horror as long as you don't desire blood to drip from your tv-set </s>

<s> when alfred hitchcock made strangers on a train it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form from 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with david o selznick ended because of this actually he made some really good films in the period such as notorious spellbound under capricorn rope and my opinion stagestruck but while notorious and spellbound were liked the audiences were turned off by hitch's attempts at experimentation his use of a dream sequence by salvator dali in spellbound was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists but the experiment with long takes in rope confused the public making ignore the merits of that film and the willingness of hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked  far more disliked then it deserved to be  in stagestruck a matter of bad timing for under capricorn it was released just as the scandal of it's star ingrid bergman and roberto rosallini broke out made it seem to be a failure which it wasn't the paradine case was another failure  and one that really had little in it's favor br br with strangers on a train hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity based on a novel by patricia highsmith the story was of how guy haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his  bruno anthony a playboy  who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete bruno is talkative and fawning and guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met if a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space but bruno knows all about guy's personal problems he is married to a promiscuous young woman named miriam and is in love with anne morton daughter of a senator bruno knows that miriam won't divorce her successful celebrity husband bruno mentions how he can sympathize  he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him then bruno mentions sort of off the cuff an idea he has about two men  technically strangers  exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them guy listens to the idea  and agrees it is an interesting idea the train reaches guy's destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea he just does not realize that the eccentric bruno is a sociopath and believes guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's foe br br it's a wonderfully simple plot actually bruno of course does kill miriam but he fully expects guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather guy is horrified  and worse he finds that he is the police department's number one suspect when bruno to encourage guy mentions he has the latter's lighter he pocketed it on the train and can plant it at the murder site guy finds himself in deeper problems  how to avoid the police and how to control if possible the insane bruno br br hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other there are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits it is like fate drawing them together yet both have their own personality  and hitch with a typical twist makes the mad bruno actually more of an attractive figure his scheme may be vicious it will kill two people if successful and he will have guy live up to the agreement no matter what but he has a zest for life one suspects that once guy too had one but his marriage's failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he was br br the cast is good too robert walker probably had his finest role in this film only a year before his death it was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of since you went away or the clock his lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes as guy farley granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in rope especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to jimmy stewart as for the ladies kasie rogers is properly sluttish as miriam  enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses so that they actually are cheering bruno in his act of evil patricia hitchcock appears as the younger sister of anne ruth roman who bears a close resemblance to miriam and accidentally sets off bruno at a social occasion she plays this rare role well ruth roman is properly supportive of granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed other supporting performers leo g caroll as the senator marion lorne usually a comedian as bruno's dotty mother and norma varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from walker are all shown to best advantage  all at the hand of a master </s>

<s> extremely entertaining mid-1950's western that packs a whole lot into just a 96-minute running time most viewers will quickly get drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable more than just a b-western but not really an epic the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite several big names glenn ford was the only box office draw at the time edward g robinson and barbara stanwyck were past their primes and looking for work stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in the big valley brian keith and dianne foster were just starting out br br ford plays john parrish a small rancher who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big rancher's robinson hired gunman parrish is a former confederate officer who only moved out west for health reasons br br robinson plays lee wilkison who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest making good on a promise to his wife martha stanwyck lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier his brother cole keith has come up from texas to help him run the huge spread lee has been turning a blind eye to obvious hookups between stanwyck and keith but sensitive daughter judith foster is understandably upset by what is going on in their home br br john parrish has promised his fiancée caroline may winn that he will move back east caroline who is modeled on grace kelly's high noon character breaks off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film this leaves the way open for a john and judith romance to develop br br the violence starts early and continues throughout the film with parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination he has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film ford plays one of his standard characters the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self deprecating manner who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked very much like his role in the sheepman br br robinson is likewise excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically just a shadow of his former self and he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character br br stanwyck has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two-faced woman a seemingly loyal wife who is scheming to replace her husband with his brother in part this is because she is not allocated enough time to do anything more than superficially convey either side of the character that said a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations br br dianne foster is a pleasant surprise she should remind viewers a lot of carroll baker both physically and in acting style although required to play judith according to 1950's convention she is allowed to be tough but then required to break into hysterics after each major confrontation foster shows a nice range she conveys a growing attraction for parrish but does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues click into place br br the real problem with the violent men is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study morality play because so much has to happen on the screen much of the action is rushed and many of the characters get only a cursory treatment this is neither fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like caroline br br then again what do i know i'm only a child </s>

<s> i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy i have seen her in kiss me kate and victor victoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is a chameleon who can play and sing anything br br i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in lucy even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy my response to that is so what i wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth i also didn't want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits  vitameatavegamin and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated  the professor and the grape stomping in particular there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having i couldn't believe she was able to capture that  and so naturally br br i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts br br i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing lucy was a star turn for rachel york i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future i also hope it brings her an emmy </s>

<s> i have some great memories watching robin of sherwood on tv as a kid but i think i only saw michael praed´s episodes by some reason and recently my brother bought the new released dvd-boxes of the complete series it was great to see it again and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv-series the cast is great and the locations mixed with clannad´s music adds this very special feeling i personally think that praed is the best of the two robins but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with ray winstone nicolas grace and robert addie is terrific in their roles as will scarlet the sheriff of nottingham and guy of gisburne it´s a pity that a fourth season never got made and i´ve also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series robert of huntingdon connery could finally have married marion judi trott or maybe herne the hunter could resurrect robin of loxley praed and he could take his revenge against the sheriff as have been mentioned before if the producers of robin hood the prince of thieves would have been smart they would have got the cast from robin of sherwood and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series as ray winstone puts it in the dvd bonusmaterial it would have been great to see them as old men just like in sean connery´s robin and marian who knows maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future in any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again </s>
<s> the journey is a very good film produced in the spring of 1958 in vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years despite the political problems which influenced the movie's success because the story happens during the hungarian revolution the cold war the journey is a very good film but not well-known i think it should be released immediately on dvd because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home one of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between deborah kerr and yul brynner their intense relationship all their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters major surov and diana ashmore another quality is the script which is very well written it was even published as a novel by the screen player george tabori the film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end at first we didn't know if diana and the other travelers could leave hungary because the communist major discovers that diana's friend paul kedes is hungarian and he isn't allowed to leave the country the major falls deeply in love with diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesn't want to let her go but after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go and the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed-the major and diana say goodbye she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including paul while surov is shot several times by some hungarians so he dies yul brynner is very very handsome and deborah kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an english lady yul and deborah are perfect together they are one of the greatest couples of the golden hollywood a true moviegoer should watch this film the journey has everything that a good film should have-a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction anatole litvak is in my opinion at his best finally i want to give a message to warner bros studios or those who restore and release classic films please release the journey on dvd as soon as possible </s>

<s> this is a tv movie based on the murder of martha moxley in greenwich in the mid 1970's based how much on truth it's hard to tell this much is certain it is based on the book written by mark fuhrman anyway the movie depicts the crime in flashbacks and its aftermath including the arrest of a suspect some 25 years after who was never considered a suspect at the time in the movie fuhram of course is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case for martha's surviving family in particular her mother the narrative of the film is by the ghost of martha moxley talking in the first person this is a very effective device in this movie to me it adds more impact to the movie and puts a human face on the murder victim if only an actress playing the part maggie grace plays martha and i was really impressed with her there is no way for certain to know mark fuhrman's motive in investigating the crime it could have been out of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared or maybe he just saw dollar signs from a future bestselling book either way it makes for an interesting movie it's well acted and fairly fast paced i don't think there was a lot of extra unnecessary stuff in the movie just what was needed to tell the story one could argue that they left out things that would have shed a bit more light on the proceedings and one would be right also one may argue that the ending was abrupt and again one would be right but as i said for me i think they told the story with at least most of the essentials anything else would have likely required a miniseries as an aside there is a miniseries entitled a season in purgatory which came out 6 years ealier 1996 which this movie has some parallels to even if only faint however if you like this movie then you may be interested in a season in purgatory it is my belief that a season in purgatory is in fact a fictionalized account of the same crime anyway for me murder in greenwich is an 8 10 </s>

film-making process and the subsequent lore from such productions as fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend br br today i sat down to fata morgana a 1969 herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard without researching the actual locations i'm assuming it was shot somewhere in africa both coastal and desert a region that could have once been the cradle of infant man infant civilization infant life on earth it is these origins the biblical notion of the garden of eden and the apocalypse that herzog is concerned with as is voiced by the narration dispensed throughout the 79 minute run time br br watching fm i couldn't help but feel i was a passenger on a profound journey in the opening sequence the title is translated as mirage and herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip these images are perverted their 3-dimensionality crushed flat by a long lens piling layers of exhaust heat waves and light aberrations all on top of one another the effect left me to conclude things are not as they seem br br fm is divided into 3 very distinct chapters 1 creation 2 paradise and 3 the golden age chapter one opens with countless languid images where bleak barren landscapes scroll by dead animals rot broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun the people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert the narration talks of a time before life a time where the canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens while the narration hearkens to a simpler purer era a portrait of a young boy holding a fox-like animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man's cruel ruthless attempt to enforce a dominion over nature br br in the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same yet the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a modicum of life and vitality we listen to a goggled biologist talk about the difficultly a monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment as he holds the squirming monitor its tongue flicking at flies he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in the searing 140 degree heat the parallel is duly noted and herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated candid portraits of individuals battered by the sun the desert and the laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm he also pushes forward the theme that if not in control man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways br br the last chapter takes us out of the desert's blast furnace and into the more familiar herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior no one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than herzog  possibly this is where he feels most at home much like errol morris herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll the subsequent flirtation herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut as morris does this extended roll pushes past the on moment the subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime their facade gives way to something real the most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2 person band playing an odd polka-like song that herzog recycles throughout this chapter the drummer of the band wears the same goggles as the biologist as does another guy doing a magic trick begging the question what's with the goggles they definitely add some levity to the film but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance or is this just another example of herzog's playfullness br br the narration aside herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary's soundtrack leonard cohen grabs the most screen time two of his beautifully melancholic songs so long marianne and suzanne perfectly accompany the scrolling landscapes adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride by the end of the journey herzog comes back to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film the distant framing of a lone vehicle traversing the endless desert engulfed by a water mirage that fills the horizon despite the overall bleakness of fm the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit belief that against all odds life will persevere and possibly even flourish br br having finished writing this post i referenced fm to discover that herzog shot it in saharan cameroon only weeks after a bloody coup true to his legend herzog and his crew were arrested beaten and imprisoned while imprisoned herzog fell ill with schistosomiasis a blood parasite it's truly hard not to love such a hypnotic and austere film as fata morgana knowing the filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all the more br br http eattheblinds blogspot com

<s> frank sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic he plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer but he can't avoid running into his old friends he had been arrested originally not for any drug-related charge but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game his skill at poker has earned him the nickname of the man with the golden arm and the men who run the game one of them being his former heroin connection want him to deal again meanwhile frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident zosch eleanor parker and make up with his old girlfriend molly kim novak the film is great at putting us in sinatra's mental state when he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film i felt good for him but when a promised phone call doesn't come one day he descends into depression and goes back on the smack later when he finally gets to audition he arrives completely strung out his embarrassment when he can't play the correct beat is devastating he had such big dreams and the other musicians don't even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room the film moves quickly and it shows frank's drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture the actors are uniformly fine elmer bernstein's score is one of the best of its time the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending br br spoilers br br although i really like the character of zosch and parker is very good in the film they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory the ending is a little too pat while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes zosch's death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly frank is free to love molly and he won't go to jail also his dealer is dead so at least the immediate threat is gone well i guess in hollywood there's always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package it harms the film a little but as it stands it's still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of 9 10 </s>

<s> dogtown and z-boys is a documentary about the zephyr skateboarding team and their influence on skateboarding it also focuses on the history of skateboarding it was directed by stacy peralta a member of the original zephyr team and was written by stacy peralta and craig stecyk another member of the team the documentary stars the members of the zephyr team and is narrated by sean penn br br the documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing it discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s its decline in the 80s and its rebirth in the 90s skateboarding was introduced in dogtown the nickname of the poor side of santa monica california the zephyr team originated from the zephyr surf shop which manufactured the first modern skateboards the documentary mainly consists of the original zephyr team members talking about the past in the zephyr team the competitions they won and their popularity and prestige it focuses on three particular members of the team peralta tony alva and jay adams three virtuosos of skateboarding and probably the best three members of the team br br the interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from dogtown in the late 60s and 70s very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed but when you do they are shown in black and white while the archival footage was in colour i think stacy peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past i e the glory days of the zephyr team and not the present the documentary is very fast paced in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era such as jimi hendrix led zeppelin and david bowie and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point knowing nothing about skateboarding i e not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground i was very surprised that i found this documentary so interesting the reason is that this doco was more about the zephyr team than the actual sport of skateboarding so while i couldn't relate to skateboarding i could relate to the boys in the team because it was made by actual members of the team it gives it a little more depth and authenticity br br all in all i would have to say this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen it gave me a whole new insight not just into the zephyr team but into skateboarding as a whole for those who love skateboarding i can only imagine how it must be even more interesting seven and a half stars out of ten </s>

<s> this was one of the best half-hour horror suspense fantasy shows of the eighties without a doubt granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode and it stank as far as production values i e the sets went but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i a hardened horror movie shock-film and 70's grind-house buff got a little sickened and creeped out great show just great regardless of what the other reviewers have said here my favorite episode was called bug house yeah that was the title i think anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day almost 20 years after it first premiered other shows like tales from the darkside the outer limits and of course the twilight zone were definitely better production values-wise but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was tales from the crypt </s>

<s> the 1990s was a great decade for british sitcom with many popular creations such as one foot in the grave absolutely faboulous the thin blue line the brittas empire and men behaving badly arriving onto tv screens for the first time br br however mr bean is hands down the greatest sitcom of the 1990s br br mr bean represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton for several decades it brings to the audience a single character  mr bean  played to perfection by rowan atkinson br br many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not mr bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability however i believe this debate is unnecessary because i highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider mr bean in such a context br br mr bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others some of his methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show this is where the humour derives from mr bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way and naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster which we then see mr bean try to resolve br br sometimes we see mr bean show a mean or petty streak often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it but no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring br br unlike most examples of british comedy in the past 30 years mr bean is simple inoffensive harmless u-rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy it is for this reason why the tv series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world it is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other tv shows will have come gone and been forgotten br br some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet i laugh just as much at mr bean's antics now as i did when i first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s rowan atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time br br the tv series has to date spawned two spin-off movies bean and mr bean's holiday as one familiar with the type of humour shown in the tv series would expect it does not translate to success on the big screen the two movies do little justice to the tv series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes the greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting in both movies the producers take mr bean out of his normal british surroundings into america the first movie and france the second movie as a result the movie characters around mr bean respond differently to his behaviour than their tv series counterparts both movies re-use gags from the tv series and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time in the second movie mr bean is shown to be behaving out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny at various times i found myself thinking that the character i was watching was not mr bean but a pale caricature it is clear that rowan atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the tv series his heart just wasn't in the performance after the second movie came out he stated publicly that he would not play mr bean again i realise how he felt br br returning to the tv series each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies br br my favourite episodes are the first three  these set the high standard that was to continue i consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless br br to summarise mr bean is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family rowan atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this tv series my recommendation  watch and enjoy but only see the movies if you consider yourself a die-hard fan after seeing the tv series </s>

<s> back in the mid late 80s an oav anime by title of bubblegum crisis which i think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire made its debut on video taking inspiration from blade runner the terminator and maybe even robocop with a little dash of batman bruce wayne  iron man tony stark and charlie's angel's girl power thrown in for good measure 8 episodes long the overall story was that in 21st century tokyo japan year 2032-2033 living machines called boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems a special swat like branch of law enforcers the advanced police ad police for short were formed to handle the boomers but were mostly ineffective prompting millionaire scientist sylia stingray the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers to create four powered combat armor hard suits to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that produced the boomers genom that group becomes known as the knight sabers and in addition to ring leader sylia her rag-tag band of rebel women included priss asagiri a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for cops linna yamazaki an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends and nene romanova a young officer of the adp and expert computer hacker the first in a long line genom meanwhile is represented by quincy a tall gaunt old guy who happens to own the company his younger assistant brian j mason killed in episode 3 and an annoying boomer man named largo other characters included leon mcnichol and daley wong two ad police detectives leon appeared in a spin-off prequel anime ad police files which i heard was very dark their balding overweight boss chief todo sylia's younger brother mackey and a funny little mechanic known as dr raven who apparently helps sylia with maintaining the suits aside from the overall knight sabers ad police vs genom storyline there was also another storyline involving a friend of linna's who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family the annoying largo trying to usurp genom and various priss-wants-revenge-for-a-minor-character story oh and did i mention that there were hints that sylia herself might have been a boomer br br well it was a great watch full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs but it was not without its flaws some of which unfortunately were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all so some of the storylines like largo's scheme or schemes the family of linna's ill-fated friend and sylia's origins were never resolved another problem with the series was that at the time priss was the most popular character so a good portion of the series focused on her and unfortunately most of the priss oriented episodes basically focused on priss self-righteously seeking justice revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers yet she rarely went out of her way for her the knight sabers who were always bailing her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her well-being just to be fair though she did go to rescue linna in episode 7 and her boyfriend got killed by a boomer and the adp acted wrongly in the investigation this meant we didn't really get to focus on the more interesting back story of sylia or even the day-to-day antics of nene and linna linna had two episodes oriented around her which pertained to her friend with the mafia family while nene managed to snag the last episode for herself which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not ditziness nene also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof which put her screen time and character development a few notches above poor linna who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention don't get me wrong i like it and i love the overall concept of it all but it did irk me a little bit also this is one of those runner-ups for worst english voice dubbing of all time features meaning you'd better stick to the japanese some of the voices were okay some really did match their characters personas but others were just flat and passionless or in the case of priss really overacted br br well tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much tosses all that out the window set a few years ahead the story here is that after earthquakes shattered tokyo genom's boomers rebuilt the city into a big old paradise except the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle which prompts the ad police to be formed followed by the knight sabers being formed so the overall story is the same but the backstories of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot br br 1 originally sylia had short purplish black hair and brown eyes was usually dressed like a stern proper business woman and was distant from others 2040 sylia has more of a super-model look to her dressing more provocatively and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray and also 2040 sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when she's not in public and possibly keeps even more secrets than before sylia also doesn't take as much risk on the battlefield as she is more of a stay-in-the-mobile-pit type here but she does do battle when she has to br br 2 originally priss was a short woman with an afro and a really bad temper always picking fights with people who offended her always biting off more than she could chew etc 2040 priss however has gone the way of the clint eastwood loner  very cold very stoic and emotionally distant more like the original sylia you might say so she's not really attached to anyone also her hair is more stingry and cat-like a big improvement and she is clad in leather like trinity from the matrix although much less annoying than before unfortunately the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the adp br br 3 originally linna had this big black hair going for her but now her hair is shorter browner and well more 90s like 2040 linna is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually harrassed as if to apologize for the way she was treated by the oav writers the 2040 writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to linna writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the knight sabers and win a spot with them which she eventually does br br 4 originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to tease and take pot shots at adp detective leon mcnichol revenge for him toying with her in the oav and other characters even her surrogate big sister linna and mackey sylia's brother whom she becomes infatuated with cockey and arrogant she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker but she is eventually deflated and grows beyond her comic relief status br br 5 nigel kirkland is a new character a tall stoic ruggedly handsome man with long black hair he looks like adrian paul from tv's highlander he replaces dr raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives maitenance to sylia's hard suits nigel is also sylia's lover but you wouldn't know it by his demeanor he's kind of the father big brother mentor figure to mackey br br 6 leon and daley are back but of course differently the original leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with slicked back brown hair blue eyes a black leather jacket tight blue jeans and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more whallop than a howitzer if necessary while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down he was kind of a jerk but he served mostly as comic relief as he tried to pursue priss romantically exactly what he saw in her is a mystery but occasionally he and daley served as information guides to important plot points also the original daley was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pink purple suits as he was a flamboyantly homosexual character who was always hitting on leon when not providing important information in 2040 leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type with spiked black hair brown eyes tall and sporting big muscles a brown leather jacket and blue dockers he actually looks like arnold schwarzenegger a little bit or maybe a pumped up colin farrell or hugh jackman and he still carries a revolver a big one but it's not as powerful as before although 2040 leon still has a bit of an attitude probelm especially in approaching priss he's not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by nene and daley also he drinks way too much coffee oh and leon is still after priss but he has a lot more luck this time around daley meanwhile is now a taller but not as tall as leon more pretty boyish looking guy with red rimmed glasses a white suit green eyes and light brown hair and he carries a big machine gun he actually looks like james marsden from the x-men films daley is a lot smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the oav and although it's not completely clear his homosexual tendencies have been almost totally disappeared save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about leon inquiring about priss's e-mail br br 7 brian j mason what does that j stand for is back and so is quincy but mason is much more the main villain here with quincy as co-villain as he is no longer a towering figure of terror but a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires plugged into him mason now sports slicked back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the oav he actually looks like oav leon in a suit and he is very much from the alan rickman school of villains br br 8 though a pervert in the first series mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040 of course there are lots of things different about mackey in 2040 but they won't be revealed here br br 9 sylia now has a companion an alfred-the-butler type named henderson who worries about her and the gang br br 10 in the original series boomers were like the replicants in blade runner armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions but in 2040 they're more of the dumb-monsters-on-the-rampage type most of the time they're just big robots who do whatever they're programmed to do heavy labor combat clean up etc and they have this tendency to go rogue which means try to evolve and become a monster in the process br br what does stay the same is the theme of humanity vs technology do machines have souls sadly this series though well animated and well written only runs 26 episodes so it moves by faster than one might like especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits which i will not discuss here what saves this show and makes it what it is however is the characters a colorful cast of screwballs they are ranging from stoic loners psycho women genocidal mad men rough neck cops sardonic intellectuals wise old sages and loveable innocents much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of they're enough to make you wish this show had gone longer br br it's not great but it's a good watch also the english dub by adv is quite good though not without a few flat spots but certainly better than the dub on the original </s>

<s> kon ichikawa had lived through world war two and saw what its effects it had on his people in japan but so did novelist shohei ooka whose book was the inspiration for ichikawa's film fires on the plain it's a film about the men in this war or perhaps more universally in wars in general who lose their humanity the soldiers trudging along through these fields and jungles of the philippenes in this story are almost completely without hope if not already just that it makes stone's platoon look like a picnic at least they had certain things like food after all br br they have little to no reserves or supplies or ammunition no back-up no sense of anything going their way in this combat that they've been thrust into they can't even get some proper hospital care unless if they can no longer walk at all or have lost limbs for example say if you have tb you're on your way but its really through the prism of one soldier a private tamura that we get a full sense of the futility of war both in its bleak scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay and those flashes of intense and brutal violence br br in the film tamura just wants to get some medical care this is right at the start and his told by his superior officer already he is with eyes that stare off and an expression that has been drained by years of battle that he will die if he doesn't find a hospital he doesn't really but does end up in with some soldiers at first with a platoon that seems to sort of have their act together but is really led on by a power-hungry brute who just wants tamura's stash of salt and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed while crossing a road at night br br the story isn't entirely a straight line but it doesn't need to be tamura's path in fires on the plain is told in vignettes little stories like when he comes upon a seemingly deserted enemy village two of the populous comes back to get some supplies and tamura sneaks up on them it's an excruciating scene since so far with tamura we haven't seen him do anything outright wrong but he does so in this scene not even so much out of evil but out of fear and desperation this is also without spoiling it how he gets a stash of salt little scenes build up so brilliantly and with devastation like a simple task of finding a pair of walkable shoes which there seem to be none or when tamura later in the film discovers his teeth are becoming torn apart and falling out from lack of total hygiene so much for food so it goes br br it should also be mentioned that this is a hauntingly realized film from ichikawa shot in a stark black and white view of the fields and woods the cinematography filling everything we see in black-blacks and white-hot white ichikawa also makes sure to get everything authentic from his actors not simply emotionally but with their own emaciated look and looks of desperation right on them it's as if ichikawa has to have them all surviving the film as well as characters surviving out in the wild by wild by the way i mean also cannibalism the shock of this is two-fold first is the way that a soldier says half-jokingly early on about eating other soldiers to tamaura who asks if it was true and only in response getting a don't ask word of caution and the second with the depiction of cannibalism itself from the crazy starving man on the hill who pulls out guts out of his lap and says with a straight face to our hero that you can eat me when i die br br this makes thing especially more brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief action scenes these are i would argue more brutal than private ryan in their depictions of violence in battle the carnage that is completely random a scene i would point to and that contains just a shot that is excruciating to watch is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly along a hail of gunfire comes that kills only four or five but it just happens so fast and the soldiers just keep walking along at the same crawl this isn't the only shot of horrible carnage that's shown  when needing to be bloody its there but splashed across the screen like something completely of the macabre  but it drives the point completely br br all of the acting is staggering funakoshi especially who looks to be both most at peace and most horrified by what he sees in the subtlest of looks most of the time all of the major set-pieces provide something else to the gruesome experience and it all amounts to the ultimate question with an anti-war film how can or why do people fight in wars like these it's almost too depressing to put into words and so ichikawa pushes our noses right up into the muck and filth and blood and demands for us to take it in so maybe some day it will never happen again or one can hope this by the end of such a bleak and great film as this </s>
<s> when melville's pierre or the ambiguities hit bookstores in 1852 his first publication since moby dick a year earlier the public response was similar to that found among the imdb reviews of pola x newspapers even published headlines like melville insane which of course he wasn't but when one compares the writing styles found in moby dick and pierre one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former clearly he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now-forgotten victorian romances that were easily outselling his immortal moby dick he was not content however to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted and that surely would have sold his version of a victorian romance was a twisted cynical one perhaps but brilliant in its synthesis the alternate title the ambiguities is quite appropriate as pierre searches for and thinks he finds truth we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe as he searches for happiness he becomes more and more miserable br br pola x is a fascinating adaptation of this novel set in modern or nearly modern france though in some ways it leaves little to the imagination and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that melville could only hint at the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact the questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask yet the answers are left to the viewer br br i recommend a reading of the novel which is much shorter than moby dick before seeing this movie i hope more people discover this tantalizing film </s>

<s> i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and vaastav more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to satya br br when i watched ab tak 56 for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own satya now the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine br br ab tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems non-existent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall br br but for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues i'm afraid i'll end up re-writing the entire script of the movie br br the movie boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as sub-inspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster  oh my god he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in him br br prasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster br br not that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best i've ever seen in hindi cinema from the way he talks to his expressions from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea  it's almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching jatin about how the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country it's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one br br last but in no way the least shimit amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the great work and doesn't give in to bollywood-isation if he can do that i'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the coming years </s>

powell made his law and order epic to the ends of the earth 1946 about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics based on nelson algren's novel that won the 1950 national book award this gritty uncompromising 119-minute black white melodrama deals with heroin addiction initially when preminger's film came out the motion picture association of america would not issue its seal of approval because the filmmakers depicted addiction to narcotics this groundbreaking film qualified as the first major motion picture to handle narcotics from the dope fiend's perspective and actually showed the paraphernalia that junkies wielded to shoot up heroin the production code stipulated that filmmakers must refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics nevertheless united artists released this unique frank sinatra picture and it grossed over 4-million dollars br br the critical and commercial success of the man with the golden arm eviscerated the production code as a result

<s> now for sure this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that bruce willis has been in to date and yet  it is still touching i really like bruce's style and persona i haven't loved everything he has ever been in but he brings it to the big-time for me in most all his film endeavors br br the story begins he is power confidence and style with a capitol s he drives a porshe he lives well in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city that's russell duritz he is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it his acclaim he is russell duritz he knows what it takes to make it it just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundation-ally set there is a problem an intruder at his home the alarm has been activated br br russell can't seem to figure out for the moment what is happening to him it's different and yet it is somehow familiar a small boy who looks exactly like  him as their lives run smack dab into each other there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him you have unfinished business to take care of now br br amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life she works with him puts up with his ego and yet she is smitten with russell very much so with rusty his past self now in the picture and talking a mile a minute singing too late at night everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly br br willis is fun egocentric and at times out of his head in this lovable disney modern times classic the kid and to add his little heavy-duty side kick spencer breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure chi mcbride is an inspirational supporting character as he is the heavy-weight champ teaching little rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the playground br br all in all this is a real winner of a movie with even lillie tomlin as the secretary and aide to russell i originally saw this back in 2000 and then again years later with equal enjoyment this is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any disney fan recommended highly </s>
<s> i do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it it's one of the best teenager horror films i've ever seen and that's saying a lot nothing is left without an explanation to back it up the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately a clear example is the mindless saint ange the first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted after the arrival to the village though the horror a different twisted kind of horror begins br br with the plot and the details goofs are minor the characters are this movie's strongest point given that so many clichés are broken in it for example the two main male characters nick and wade are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to although dalton might fit better in this stereotype not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness some scenes are truly satisfyingly horrible making up for tense moments scattered around all the film and in the end and although everything is decorously explained it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters br br the only errors i can see and which do not imply continuity ie carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious bo's pockets is the illumination which is somehow annoying during the first boring 30 minutes although plot and effects-wise everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to ambrosia that little village in the midst of nothing so i'll give it that it's been pretty much argued that about 70 of the movie is illogical how can two people build an entire house of wax where do they get all the wax from these wouldn't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie the sinclair brothers did not build the house of wax their mother worked making actual wax figures and they were exhibited at the museum and the scenario where paris hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question what is with all the personal objects mobile phones cars clothes of the dead people using their third brother as a connection with the exterior it's pretty much arguable that the sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax in a wwii-type fashion br br so that aside i think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets and nobody should lose the chance to watch it so go see the house of wax right now </s>

<s> i first heard of this one while searching the net for reviews of another italian giallo horror effort the contemporaneous the perfume of the lady in black 1974 whose r2 se dvd from raro video by the way i recently acquired  where it's referenced as being in a similar vein but also just as good having watched footsteps for myself now i can see where that reviewer was coming from  in that both films deal with the psychological meltdown of their female protagonist stylistically however this one owes far more to art-house cinema than anything else  in particular the work of alain resnais and michelangelo antonioni and specifically last year in marienbad 1961 and the passenger 1975 respectively accordingly some have accused it of being deadly boring  an epithet often attached to such pretentious read cerebral fare br br anyway the film involves the quest of a woman florinda bolkan to determine her movements in the preceding three days  of which she seems to have no recollection following a series of cryptic clues she travels to the mythical land of garma nearby locations then bear the equally fictitious names of muda and rheember  where she encounters several people including lila kedrova as an aristocratic regular of the resort who ostensibly recall the heroine staying there during her blackout most prominent though are a young man peter mcenery and a little girl nicoletta elmi from mario bava's baron blood 1972  the former always seems to happen on the scene at propitious moments while the latter apparently confuses bolkan with another woman sporting long red hair and a mean streak br br while essentially a mood piece this is nonetheless a gripping puzzle inevitably vague events transpire at a deliberate pace  and where much of the film's power derives from the remarkable central performance which can be seen as an extension of bolkan's role in the fine lucio fulci giallo a lizard in a woman's skin 1971 however there's no denying the contribution of cinematographer vittorio storaro who provides any number of sweeping camera moves and an effective color scheme  adopting orange red blue filters to create atmosphere and coming up with a saturated look for the disorientating bizarre finale and nicola piovani's fitting melancholy score the composer is best-known nowadays for his oscar-winning work on roberto benigni's holocaust-themed tragi-comedy life is beautiful 1997 br br with this in mind it's worth discussing how footsteps was presented in the version i watched well being apparently hard-to-get in its original form i can't be sure whether it's uncut here or not except to say that the film ran for 89 minutes while the imdb  lists it at 96 this edition is culled from a fairly battered english-language vhs the dubbing is surprisingly good given the international cast with burnt-in swedish subtitles to boot besides the divx copy froze for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the 82-minute mark still we do get a welcome bonus i e a 9-minute highlights from the soundtrack in mp3 format br br i realize i haven't yet mentioned the moon mission subplot to which klaus kinski's presence is restricted incidentally around this same time he had a similarly brief but pivotal role in another good arty thriller with sci-fi leanings and also set in a distinctive location  namely lifespan 1974 as i lay watching the film i couldn't fathom what possible connection this had with the central plot except that bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen though not through to the end called footsteps on the moon a somewhat misleading alternate title for the film itself  amusingly she at first recalls the picture as being called blood on the moon which of course is a classic 1948 western noir with robert mitchum and directed by robert wise that said i took this diversion in stride as merely one more outlandish touch to the film given also bolkan's former employment as a translator at a conference discussing earth's future  and certainly didn't expect the astronauts to turn up on garma's beach at the very end to pursue the female lead where the sand then turns ominously into the moon's surface br br the film's plot will probably make more sense on a second viewing  though to be honest this is best approached as a visual aural experience and one shouldn't really expect it to deliver a narrative that's in any way clear-cut and easily rationalized for the record the only other bazzoni effort i'd managed to catch prior to this one was the middling straight giallo the fifth cord 1971 starring franco nero which i had recorded off late-night italian tv some time ago i did get hold of his spaghetti western rendition of carmen titled man pride and vengeance 1968  also with nero and kinski  as a divx after i'd already missed a matinée broadcast of it but the conversion had somehow proved faulty and consequently the disc wouldn't play properly </s>

<s> as a former highland rugby hr player i feel like i can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been put forward i think that i am also in a position to offer some insight into the club and back stories oh and this is gonna be a long post i can tell already br br first off the people who said that the movie doesn't show real rugby have a valid point the movie is full of bad tackles people in the wrong places and much much more if you want to know what a real rugby game feels like you won't get the best idea from this movie but the thing is anything short of actually sitting down and watching a highlight reel or jumping into a game yourself is not going to be satisfactory it's hollywood not espn really how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game not many that i have seen i think it's important to keep in mind that the movie is about rugby players much more than it is about rugby br br next the haka is very much a part of highland rugby it is not something that they just threw into the movie to be honest i don't know how the tradition got started but highland emulates the all blacks in many ways the uniform is based off of the all blacks as well the movie did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the haka and to be honest i don't think that that is right but i can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means as for the person from china who said that only a maori can perform a haka i would suggest that they take a look at the all blacks and tell me if they think that they are all maori believe it or not utah has a very large polynesian community and a good portion of them like and play rugby for the local teams i myself am part hawaiian whenever possible the haka is led by a maori the team does not do it because they think that they are maori they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie the concept of unity and those who have gone before is a huge part of the hr culture and the message behind the haka for any of those that are familiar with it support those values it's a chant by a chief who thought he would die ka mate and those around him supporting him telling him he will live ka ora and boosting him up how appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do it is not for me to say but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done kia kaha is also a well used team motto even if the actors had a hard time saying it br br also for the people who questioned highland's rugby playing ability i would just remind you that you were not really watching highland play in this movie many of the extras were former players from highland and other teams but the main characters were all actors believe it or not highland really is pretty good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community granted some years produce better teams than others it's what you would expect with any sports team but you don't accumulate hr's win record by just being okay the year after i graduated 1998 highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the world schools rugby championship in zimbabwe the teams were hand picked from around the world and represented the best of high school rugby talent at the time highland obviously didn't win first place new zealand did that but they did manage to take third place in the tournament beating the tongan national champions in their last match and while american rugby may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about highland also has a tradition of touring new zealand every few years and usually comes back with more wins than losses br br the majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based off of real people and real stories i watched this movie with my brothers who also played for highland and between the four of us we were fairly certain that we were able to identify almost every main character nobody knew a white rasta of course as this wasn't a documentary hollywood did take some liberties but to tell you the truth not as many as you might think the film was actually pretty accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practices as well as the mandatory personal running and weight training sometimes it really was running until you threw up it also showed the service and other team activities like the chuck-a-rama buffet that were very much a part of team bonding br br and finally the movie in my obviously very biased opinion it was a pretty good movie and i think that the reason for it is that i watched it as an inspirational sports movie i didn't think that it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy award winning drama it was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team complete with morals encouragement and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment i hope that i addressed some of the problems that people have had with the movie and hope that you can now enjoy it for what it was br br kia kaha </s>
<s> what's there to say about pink flamingos it is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen you will either get it or you won't laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust or both john waters is an odd filmmaker putting that mildly mixing both innocent childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to well who knows what his intentions were it is like a form of assault albeit a funny one br br the thing that makes waters's humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer like the petty rivalries that form the plot of pink flamingos surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of the filthiest person alive what makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that waters creates giddy self-contained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away the people in his films are completely in tune with one another for instance when cotton tells babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because crackers is bringing his lady friend out to the trailer babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her in a conspiratorial aside that little shed's just perfect at this point we do not know yet that crackers plans to take his lady friend out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while cotton watches orgasmically through a window but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that waters creates br br another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and channing the marbles deviant butler the first time we see them waters cuts jarringly from a scene in connie's cozy office to channing descending into the basement where we see that there are two women down there one dead and one very much alive and p ed off susan is not a cowering victim but is enraged and abusive to channing leaping up to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer they both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious she does not let up for one second while channing is in her sight and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film later in the film when divine and crackers break into the marbles's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the marbles are pandering--here is something divine is unfamiliar with a corruption devised by her newfound rivals and she despises it furthermore while kidnapping does not seem like something divine would think twice about she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free relishing the revenge that they take on channing br br at the other end of the filth spectrum waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the real world the first time we see connie she is belittling a minor character named sandy sandstone who has never heard of divine cookie on the other hand reacts with a hilariously matter-of-fact evaluation of divine's title as the filthiest person alive revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well br br something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles especially divine who doesn't miss a note not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given and it takes pink flamingos to a new level or weirdness people actually believed divine was like this in real life and it's easy to understand why because while watching the movie you're not really thinking about the movie you're thinking about these people who made it since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary br br but even more so pink flamingos is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now i say mostly because the a hole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince i still find this film to be hilarious and habit-forming </s>

<s> the beguiled is a strange work among clint eastwood's oeuvre by 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies not only westerns the genre in which he first made his name but also war films such as where eagles dare and cop thrillers such as coogan's bluff yet although the beguiled takes place during wartime the american civil war and was made by don siegel who had earlier directed eastwood in coogan's bluff and was later the same year to direct him in dirty harry it is not an action film in the traditional sense in most of his previous films eastwood had played an active role but here his role is largely passive his character sergeant john mcburney is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive even while serving with his unit mcburney played no active part in the conflict he is a quaker whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms and was serving with the union forces as a medical orderly br br the film is set in louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured mcburney being discovered by a young girl named amy and brought back to her boarding school the school is a small one with only two teachers and a handful of girls although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities the headmistress martha farnsworth decides to shelter him and tend him fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the confederacy's notoriously harsh prison camps br br although mcburney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls and he wins the affections of number of them including miss farnsworth her assistant edwina and carol one of the older girls even twelve year old amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him in the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred and miss farnsworth rejected in favour of the sluttish carol plots a terrible revenge interestingly the one female to resist mcburney's blandishments is hallie miss farnsworth's black slave even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her br br the beguiled has been described as an anti-war film but this seems to me to be a misconception the film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the civil war or of war in general the only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge not by zeal for the confederate cause it would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war br br at the beginning the school set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion seems like an island of peace amid the war the building is in the classical style associated with order harmony and restraint but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder passion and violence qualities associated with the gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of classicism the film can be seen as falling within what has been called the southern gothic tradition in american film and literature br br the film was not a great hit at the box office possibly because eastwood was cast so much against type it is not perhaps his best film but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes in play misty for me his first film as director made the following year he was again to play a passive character in danger from a vindictive female there are some very good performances from the female members of the cast particularly geraldine page as martha farnsworth outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions there are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother there are also good contributions from elizabeth hartman as the shy repressed edwina who falls in love with mcburney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young pamelyn ferdin as amy amy is an animal lover a key moment in the film comes when mcburney kills her pet turtle so it is interesting that in later life ferdin became an animal rights activist the one character i was less keen on was jo ann harris's carol who seemed too modern like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s the film is notable for the emotionally intense hothouse atmosphere which siegel brings to it this will not be a film which is to everyone's taste some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic and some have found it misogynistic judith crist called it a film for woman haters and sadists others however may find it a compelling psychological drama 7 10 </s>

<s> though not hal hartley's best work my personal favorite is surviving desire there is still much to like about this movie especially for fans of hartley's dialogues even to audiences new to hartley i would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric dogma this movie is more intelligent truer to its source material the bible and more fun than any of the other pre-millennium apocalypse movies br br this movie is actually part of the french 2000 as seen by 2000 par vu series as such it is perhaps even a lower-budget film than hartley's other works while the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry jittery effect i'd be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again especially at the beginning it almost makes the movie unwatchable but overlook this flaw and you'll be treated to a fine film especially notable is magdalena played by p j harvey relating how jesus saved her from being stoned to death a short scene i found surprisingly moving despite the fact that it was not mary magdalene that this happened to the woman in the bible was unnamed br br </s>

<s> i've read some grumbles about the court scenes these people betray their ignorance this production went to simply amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred courtly manners are something few people outside the court ever see while the acting may appear highly stylized it is in fact as close a replication as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations as the director could create the actor's facial expressions are a marvel particularly the duplicitous marquis changxin and the king's mother br br there are of course reflections of both greek and shakespearian tragedy in the relationship between the king his parents and his love the juxtaposition of the king transforming from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of an individual's nature this movie would provide much to ponder in a college course on the humanities br br at the same time it almost rushes along even in the slowest scenes heading towards an inexorable denouement one suspects the involvement of large portions of the troop movements which were quite awesome it makes the lord of the rings battle scenes pale by comparison few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of humans on the field of battle just for art's sake i recall one scene in which at least 30 000 troops can be seen moving across a huge plain the logistics for such a shot would have been staggering br br i could go on but simply i can't recommend this film highly enough </s>

<s> one has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12-hour long films it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence  in fact even in the world of arthouse cinema such mammoth running times are extremely rare for obvious reasons this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common the generally accepted running time of 90-120 minutes with a minority of movies that dare to approach but rarely exceed the three-hour mark br br for this reason a film like out 1 runtime 729 minutes is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find br br originally devised as a tv series by maverick nouvelle vague director jacques rivette it raised little interest from the french networks and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead peter watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo documentary the war game although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time shown a couple of times in 1971 out 1 has re-emerged at a handful of rivette retrospectives over the last two decades and many who have seen it including esteemed us critic jonathan rosenbaum have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time br br is it well yes if you like rivette that alone is a big if as jacques rivette has never been a commercially successful director only two of his films were hits celine and julie go boating 1974 and la belle noiseuse 1991 both superb and many remain difficult to find on dvd today out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded nevertheless he is greatly respected within the film community and with good reason  his playfully surreal narratives sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema's most unique and satisfying film-makers br br out 1 deals with a theme that re-occurs throughout rivette's work the nature of acting particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation his fascination with acting make rivette's films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together out 1 is roughly divided into four major narratives gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops two consisting of acting troupes each trying to devise post-modern theatrical adaptations of aeschylus plays the other two individual petty thieves played by nouvelle vague icons jean-pierre léaud and juliet berto pursuing eccentric methods of making money and an overarching plot involving a mysterious balzac-inspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as the thirteen br br as with any rivette film featuring a conspiracy narrative the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post-1968 ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era for a film made in 1971 these were remarkably prescient themes another french director in jean eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his 1973 masterpiece the mother and the whore but this is not the limit of out 1's scope br br comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each the beginning of each episode has a brief abstract black-and-white still montage of the events of the previous chapter out 1 is no less watchable than any quality tv series and may even be better experienced on a one-episode at-a-time basis this is not to say that it doesn't remain challenging even when viewed in segments like most rivette films it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot of sorts and some of those early scenes particularly the sequences depicting the actors heavily abstracted exercises seem interminably long these scenes are important however not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film paradoxically long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience and this understanding of pacing has led rivette along with more modern directors like michael haneke and béla tarr to create films with less commercial running-times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled br br in a film that is in many ways about acting the acting is fantastic many famous nouvelle vague faces appear including the aforementioned léaud and berto the outstanding michel lonsdale and rivette regular bulle ogier even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene the people and architecture of paris c 1971 though seem to have an equally significant role  the city landscapes crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze out 1 in time a document of a place at a point in history br br after a little more than 720 minutes the film ends on an impossibly brief enigmatic note yet the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities intricacy and spontaneity that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow for film-makers film critics and artists of all disciplines this is something to be cherished </s>
<s> in this tale of a tightly wound christian family that has three of its four members born again after a cake-caused car crash what really stands out is how grounded most of it is where there is so much potential to go over the top and how truly inspired most of the acting is where most of the film's moments particularly its frank and innocent discussions of sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed is hilarious it is also thought-provoking and the characters stay with you br br how often for example does a character in a comedy spin from near caricature to full-bodied emotional being in the course of one scene how often do we see a cast that can pull back from showboating mid-sentence in order to show a bit of the humanity beneath the character's skin even many of the bad guys in this film have moments of heart-breaking honesty even while much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrifying there is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film which is a difficult task in satire br br how refreshing it is to see a darkish comedy that can dare to be humanistic how nice to see actors so fully committed to character that they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublime br br and as a gay person i do not think i have ever been quite so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as i was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accident br br bravo bravo one of my favorites at outfest this year </s>

<s> visconti's death in venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made while watching we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius endlessly opulent death in venice surely is but in other important ways it's an unsatisfying film thomas mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von aschenbach's literary career and output of his imperious manner his layer-upon-layer of programmed self-conscious behavior when tadzio appears and obsession arises it's evident that aschenbach hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his gilded-age trappings and carefully lived life in fact upon seeing tadzio the solitary  as mann sometimes calls him splits in two aschenbach no 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14-year old boy then attempts to intellectually process the giddy jolt in blood pressure as he would a work of art  a divine work of art but aschenbach no 2 emerges as a stalker who takes control of then replaces the rational aschenbach no 1 like the original aschenbach his sexual-doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession  and thus tadzio remains a far-off ideal thomas mann has no mercy for this game every shred of self knowledge comes too strong and too late the excitement of sexual flush is too great to resist that venice is gripped by disease means nothing to aschenbach  except that his game now has higher stakes when he finally whispers beneath his breath i love you  he knows that all is lost and the abyss awaits is any of this filmable perhaps and visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from but there are errors he and dirk bogarde create aschenbach as sympathetic mann again did not aschenbach's pov dominates the film and we are expected to identify but nowhere on screen is there a man being torn apart from within bogarde toggles between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculously temperamental with ease  but what's underneath bogard's reactive performance has no mooring mann writes a character who is in his imagination doing the dance of the seven veils all too aware of the consequences such freedom invites yet unable unwilling to resist also visconti's screenplay creates a character not in the original  alfred a friend of aschenbach's  to dramatize mann's discussion of art and artists these scenes are badly written disasters and the actor who portrays alfred is difficult to watch also visconti's aschenbach is a gilded-age teutonic composer which i think works for the film and the symphonies of mahler substitute for aschenbach's novels mahler's great music unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly played so death in venice as visconti hands it to us is not the complete success it might have been but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied all students of film especially cinematography will want to take a look </s>

an official man who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city if the eyeballs work is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited if

every day seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity to see daily life replicated in a speculative light den brysomme mannen makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy as quotidian life becomes a performance which transforms karl marx's meaning of the word alienation because here the men and women in the office do identify with their labor like actors in a play who conspire to

to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man this inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures amplifies the bothersome man's need for love where simple pleasures compensated

gestures that require performances from both the man and woman when ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving anne britt for her this norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic but odd city with an open-endedness that's solvable and offer up multiple interpretations br br wounded by ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of

andreas attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the

<s> 78 years ago the premiere of anna christie advertised by the slogan garbo talks the film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence into sound a few seconds closing her silent era and at last greta garbo says a historic line gimme a whiskey ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy baby br br anna christie 1930 is the movie by clarence brown that introduced a great silent star greta garbo to talkies nowadays we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses the careers of many were bound to end  something we hardly or not at all see at present and it was no coincidence that it was clarence brown who directed the first talkie with the swedish beauty garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions flesh and the devil 1926 and a woman of affairs 1928 movies that achieved a smashing success at the box office both with garbo in the lead br br but we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie now purely historical appears to be of minor importance the question for today's viewer is not what garbo's voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these 78 years in other words we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time has it br br when i recently watched it i came into conclusion that except for some minor technical aspects including static camera anna christie is still very entertaining it's on the one hand a wonderful story of a life of a reality that the young woman faces being based on eugene o neill's play and on the other hand an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs br br content chris christopherson george f marion a heavy drinker lives a life of a sailor on a barge although his days are filled with sorrows he is consoled by a letter from his daughter anna garbo whom he hasn't seen for 15 years she says that she will come back to him he starts to change everything for better however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 year-old woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in minnessota where she lived and worked moreover he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life this brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than anna her father chris makes you realize how universal it is simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been erased after all these years cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid br br performances there are not many characters in the movie but there are two that really shine in the roles it is of course greta garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 year-long phenomenon the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema something i have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films but here garbo is slightly different i admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role that seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in english however her performance is as always genuine and unique but that is what everyone has expected from garbo the true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is marie dressler as marthy she is excellent in her facial expressions in her accent in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of hitting the bottle her best moments include the conversation with anna christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious talk with chris the rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever here the german version makes up for it particularly dressler except for garbo herself constitutes an absolutely flawless choice br br if you asked me what i like about anna christie nowadays that's what i would tell you it's a classic movie however there is one more thing that i must mention at the end it is humor wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout although the content is quite serious and anna christie in no way carries a comedian spirit the only garbo's comedy was ninotchka there are such moments when you will split your sides don't skip for instance anna and matt's visit in the fun park particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how virtuous and innocent she is beer for himself and where suddenly marthy joins them by chance br br anna christie is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance if you are fed up with many of those modern starlets seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied very worth your search br br skaal greta garbo skaal marie dressler let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie skaal after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense </s>

<s> there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if they're not careful you really need to follow what leland says and read his character to figure out the intended why the movie presents at the end nothing it solid it's not definite it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it i think that was the plan from the get-go people aren't meant to all understand it in the same way it's almost about forming your own personal relationship with leland in order to maybe feel him a little better br br the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is it's dramatic and thought provoking a lot of heavy ideas but the pace of the movie is almost soothing even with its more intense scenes with yelling i think it's probably leland he's just calm and almost serene even for all of his sadness the movie personifies leland in a way br br of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it but there are some recycled ideas i mean leland has a lot of impressive dialogue he is anything but typical but he's not a prophet everything he says is not a revelation many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned even i have observed a few things he's observed leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan gosling's portrayal br br in the end the acting is all exceptional there are no real bad guys there is no way to psychologically evaluate leland only to maybe understand him and life a little better br br comparable to igby goes down i think not comedic but similar in its general outlook on life </s>

<s> even people who dislike the film usually because they find the ending confused should appreciate the strong acting of elijah wood joseph mazello who played the two young leads in this movie br br spoiler warning at a literal level the ending makes no sense people who think the ending makes some sense at other levels are divided between those who 1 think the younger brother was killed by the step-father either the one time mike the older boy was away dealing with the neighborhood gang or flew off the wishing spot in his wagon to escape the situation through death those 2 who think the younger brother is imaginary his flying off in the wagon transformed into a flying machine signals his overcoming the abusive situation br br i favor 2 it makes a lot of sense in terms of the way many children deal with abusive situations it is not uncommon for an abused child to split his or her psyche project the abused self into something else a stuffed animal even an imaginary friend this way it makes a lot more sense that it is always the younger boy who is abused never mike in reality it is unlikely for one of two brothers to get all the abuse although that does happen also it is bobby the younger brother who is also the encouraging one the one who insists that they can overcome the situation also the death of a real-life sibling through abuse would have been too shattering for an adult with this in his history to transform into as upbeat a fantasy ending as this </s>

<s> first of all there is a detective story légitime défense by belgian stanislas andré steeman whose l'assassin habite au 21 clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942 with pierre fresnay and the same actress suzy delair steeman complained about clouzot's adaptation for both movies the movie from 1942 was excellent but the detective story side had been kept so why complaining as for quai des orfèvres clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career after having directed le corbeau and been blacklisted he had a lot more to say than a simple whodunit steeman complained essentially about the poor detective ending which i will not reveal of course but clouzot focused on the social vignettes on his characters's psychology and he did not give a damn about the puzzle à la agatha christie by doing so he becomes the genuine predecessor of claude chabrol who has always been closer to him than to alfred hitchcock whom he admires much though suzy delair has great screen presence and you will love the song she really sings she was a singer too avec son tralala bernard blier gives as ever a sparing of gestures and words performance and he really pulls it off two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing the first one dora the photographer she takes pictures of female models and clouzot by subtle touches reveals us she's a lesbian of course the word is never uttered how could it be in 1947 the police chief fabulous louis jouvet tells her you and me we are not lucky with women the portrait of this cop is very detailed we learn a lot of things about him not necessary connected with the delair blier plot he's a widower with a son he adores and who runs into school difficulties particularly in geometry so we get to know all the characters in depth one of the most important manifesto of post-war french cinema </s>

<s> talk radio sees a man somewhat accidentally stumble through life indeed the american dream from whatever bog-standard and everyday job he has in a store to presenter of a local radio show before going right the way through to the same job only later syndicated nationwide it's a role he adopts out of his own aggression and natural mannerisms a frothing mad approach to freedom of speech as he attacks just about everyone and everything even those that often call up to agree with him or compliment him his role as a man that rants on all things good evil right wrong political religious moral and immoral is something that people seem to take to in one form that of it's entertaining and worth tuning in for but additionally on a plane of rejection and antagonism  two things born out of the very things seemingly encouraged in professional working life in the western world this towards a man as he gets to the very top of his game by way of the american dream and dealing in freedom of speech as people take to a man but do anything but take to what it is he says br br talk radio begins with a montage of tall towering buildings in a business based area of dallas texas the skyscrapers are shot from a ow angle and tower over the viewer plus everything else in the general vicinity as this voice of one man tears through the images belting out statements and information on items as these monolithic buildings dominate out screen they are the very physical representation of capitalism while the voice of what we learn to be a radio dj is the oral representation of the free west personal speech and opinions on anything and everything stone will finish his film in the exact same manner in which he started it although the film is anything but a circular journey of any sort as the characters undergo monumental changes in both what they witness and their general livelihood rather the shots of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed the ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist people subscribe to them but it does them more harm than good before the re-establishment that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist in churning out the sorts of people on display in the film until someone or something drastically changes things br br the dj is barry champlain a man with a radio show on a local texan station dealing with just about anything champlain's somewhat carefree attitude to some pretty explosive content is established when he flies from one call with a bigoted man whom recently visited a holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend has supposedly overdosed and onto both the berating and mocking of a pizza shop to us the content comes across as quite shocking to these people everything seems to be business as usual which plants some serious seeds of both doubt and horror within the minds of us the newcomers to all of this br br what barry's show is about nobody ever seems to really establish everything and nothing indeed time is taken in the form of either jingles or dialogue that the shows immediately pre and post champlain's show are on specific subjects gardening for instance and are hosted by calm speaking and methodical people whom i'm sure do not flit from one random or extreme to another all the time raising the stakes one wonders what barry's jingle is the kind that plays around about lunch time during someone else's show coming up later the barry champlain show featuring the village idiot and psychotic drug abusers indeed his show's introductory piece carries a matter-of-fact tone a shouting at the audience as a loud rock track accompanies it br br barry's success arrives in the national syndication proposal it's born out of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and that they have for him the furthering of the material and the upping of the stakes ought to call into question just how far they think they can take this and whether this progressing down a track for sake of entertainment is really worth it it is when the show reaches this level of broadcast that barry seems to come unstuck for the first time in his broadcasting life when a supposed serial rapist calls in and leaves mostly everyone slightly stunned it's at this point the camera pauses on barry and by way of depth of focus encompasses those same looming towering buildings the film began with which stand outside of the window directly behind barry they remain tall and proud specifically of the ideologies they've been built on and this furtherance of freedom of speech in broadening barry's show nationwide as one man climbs his profession's ladder suddenly clashes with the sort of content that's being offered everything reaches a point too far and that with freedom ought to at least come a sense of clarity rather than a mere revelling br br oliver stone made talk radio right in the middle of both a fascinating and explosive period of film-making he had in the late 1980s in this time he produced a series of really well received films in a pretty short space of time beginning with one of my favourite war films in platoon before continuing with the quite brilliant wall street and eventually finishing with 1991's jfk one might even say that this run continued on into the mid-nineties with natural born killers talk radio is like its lead character in the sense it's loud booming stark and confrontational it isn't anti-capitalism as much as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is just going too far for sake of popularity and riches talk radio is certainly a film that sticks in the memory </s>
