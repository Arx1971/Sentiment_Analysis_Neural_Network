<s> in terms of the arts the 1970s were a very turbulent era in literature and the visual arts it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted in music it was a decade that many see as a low point due to corporate rock and disco on television it was a golden age for situation comedies from the odd couple to the mary tyler moore show to m a s h to all in the family but in film it was even a greater period of creativity in all genres that saw the rise of the american auteur directors like robert altman francis ford coppola and martin scorsese from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated hollywood for over half a century these directors wanted to craft literate arts films for the masses of the sort that had been staples in europe since the end of the second world war yet the studios were trying to keep pace with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s br br but unlike the films of the 1930s starring actors like jimmy cagney and john garfield usually co-starring the dead end kids that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s manifested itself most in science fiction films which allowed the left wing of hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment there was precedent for this approach for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the mccarthy era most notably the day the earth stood still and invasion of the body snatchers and the early 1960s saw rod serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show the twilight zone among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive silent running george lucas's first film thx 1138 which dealt with consumerism group think and existentialism and logan's run which hammered away at communism and state control versus the rights of an individual some of the film's references are quite heavyhanded and reek of the then current arab oil crisis and rampant inflation a few jarred strawberries cost 150 and soylent rations its assorted colored foods soylent yellow soylent red and the new soylent green reputedly made from the finest undersea growth  in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film's release and the scenes of crowding and bodies live and dead lying all about are still chilling as well as influential a later film like escape from new york is an obvious progeny the rest of the script by stanley r greenberg however is rather pedestrian and fairly standard for a dystopian flick but fleischer and cinematographer richard h kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds to spice things up the use of soft dimly lit visuals murkily filtered add a stygian feel to the new york of the film almost like a colorized version of carl theodor dreyer's vampyr the only light in the film comes from artificial sources and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless br br the end of the film where thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into soylent green wafers is both chilling and oddly drama-less in the end the soylent minions hunt thorn down but he survives long enough to utter the film's catchphrase to chief hatcher yet one does not know if it is enough for hatcher has already been co-opted and has a track record of taking the easy way out yet that fact and its ambiguity shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters dilemmas and has a depth many later better made films sci fi or not do not have it is also why soylent green is still a film worth watching </s>

<s> walt disney his 9 old men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of cinderella which i guess you could say helps form an unofficial fairy tale princess trilogy from the classic disney years br br the plot cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break she is the daughter of a nice wealthy widower who loved her dearly but her mother passed away when cinderella was very young and cindy's father felt she needed a mother figure so he eventually married the woman who would become known as lady tremaine herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as cinderella anastasia and drizella at first they all seemed to get along but then cinderella's father died and lady tremaine's true nature was revealed  she was a cold cruel callous heartless mean spirited woman and she passed those traits on to her daughters who were spoiled bratty and equally mean spirited anastasia drizella hate cinderella because they know deep down that she's better looking and an overall nicer more attractive lady than themselves i e more appealing to men and their mother lady tremaine hates cindy for pretty much the same reasons as the years passed lady tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve refine her awkward unattractive daughters to call them homely would be an insult to homely people everywhere while all three relegated cinderella to being the multi-tasking servant of the house abusing her mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload that brings us to cinderella in the present where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor br br cinderella gets her shot at freedom happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife settle down start a family etc naturally her step family tries to keep her from attending even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself with a little help from her mice friends  the dress belonged to her biological mother finally pushed beyond her breaking point cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair it is at that point that her fairy godmother a short plump jolly woman arrives and provides cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress after all cinderella wouldn't make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped cindy arrives at the ball the prince falls hard for her but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way forcing her to flee but leaving behind a glass slipper make a long story short  after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper cinderella is found and she and the prince get married giving her the happy ending she deserves br br overall an enjoyable disney classic not without its flaws the most glaring of which is that the prince is little more than a macguffin to help push the plot along  he has very little screen time and even less dialogue so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with cinderella which is unfortunate since according to the making of documentary the prince was originally meant to play a bigger role and a few additional scenes to help flesh out cinderella herself might have been helpful there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step-family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy which was cut because walt himself thought it made her look spiteful still cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine even if she is upstaged by her mice friends and there's a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days of course if this were being made now cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window but this is beside the point br br and for all those who say cinderella sets a bad example for young girls well consider this  at least cinderella didn't go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed unlike some modern day princesses you know who i mean </s>

<s> i haven't liked many tv shows post 1990 but that 70s show is great never seeing it during it's first run thinking a gimmicky period piece i was wrong i started watching in reruns and the more i watched the more i liked now it is the only show premiering post-1990 that i watch regularly br br although that 70s show mimics some of the styles attitudes music and tastes of the 70s it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s it contains so much funny witty biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clichés by just being humorous the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable br br although a hilarious sitcom no matter what time period the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity but its the focus on universal issues family problems teen angst marital issues peer pressure dealing with all of them with comic aplomb that gives the show a mass appeal br br the show's center is one eric forman played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace eric is a super-skinny geeky-looking non-athletic teen and still comes off as super-cool due to grace's brilliant self-deprecation of the character eric has 5 friends donna hyde kelso jackie and fez played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon danny masterson ashton kutcher mila kunis and wilmer valderama we get to see life in point place wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see donna a forward-thinking feminist is the object of eric's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity hyde is eric's best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him hyde is the mellow zen cool one of the group and just sits back observes and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever jackie who starts out as kelso's girlfriend is a verbose self-absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b c of kelso but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her and finally fez fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country we never know exactly where and he is a scene-stealer i said good day you son of a b tch valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he hasn't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen his scene-stealing moments often help make the show for me br br the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be the gang repeatedly gets into trouble most of it on purpose they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other they hang out most of the time in eric's basement plotting pontificating or just plain playing around br br also figuring prominently in the show are eric's parents the menacing commie-hating red and the lovable happy-go-lucky kitty played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp these 2 adults give the show a much-needed mature point-of-view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do-wells red and kitty are ably supported by donna's parents the buffoonish bob played wonderfully for the full run by don stark and blonde bimbo daft midge the super-sexy tanya roberts who was on the show for about half it's run additionally for 3 full seasons eric's sister from hell laurie played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrah-fawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents sides kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 eps but unfortunately kelly's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6 the newbie didn't last thankfully and was gone after a few season 6 eps br br sadly at the end of season 7 topher grace eric and early in season 8 ashton kutcher kelso left the show and it never recovered as season 8 turned out to be it's last grace and kutcher returned for the series finale though giving the show a satisfying end br br a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor top notch supporting players were eternally high leo played to the hilt by tommy chong pastor dave roy the terrific comic jim gaffigan big rhonda mitch earl etc they also got legends marion ross happy days and betty white the mary tyler moore show to play red and kitty's mothers respectively many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well from shirley jones partridge family to pamela sue martin nancy drew to charo to ted nugent to k i s s it goes on and on br br with great

<s> i thoroughly enjoyed this flick i am of the firm belief that matt stone and trey parker are comic geniuses of our time they have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way if that makes any sense this is mainly what makes south park soooo funny once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed that is apparent in baseketball although it is directed by david zucker and is utterly rediculous it has a sincere message about corporate america and the disgrace that is major league sports i am also a fan of sports so i find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love the opening prologue is brilliant tears from laughter form everytime i see those football players begin riverdance some may not like this movie because it's just not everyone's cup of tea but just like south park once you look past the absurdity it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius i gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars </s>

a stroke of genius by kevin smith's good buddy jason lee brian is writing a book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again and that is the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two br br at david's huge birthday bash so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday brian enters with his date sofia sorrano played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress this is a bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another and in typical david fashion despite his best friend being there he begins to flirt with sofia to complicate things julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david david then spends the night with sofia but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another there is no hanky panky the next day as david is leaving sofia's apartment he is greeted by julie who offers him a ride and from there well i think we have all seen the commercials br br that is all i will really say about the plot because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception we are introduced to a character played by kurt russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze there is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us but it doesn't end there br br like many movies seem to thrive on today this film has a secret sixth sense may have began this craze but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze regardless of how it originated vanilla sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up something more i can understand to be able to work your mind in the theater to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film all of the ersatz so called best pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular they lack substance a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven vanilla sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it br br this is what film making is supposed to be like this is what a film is supposed to do to you it is supposed to make you feel something most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces this one isn't br br 10 out of 10 the best film of the year i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see cruz up for best actress diaz for best supporting cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor cameron crowe should there as well none of this may come to pass and that is a shame this is one film that should not be missed br br and on a final note i am quite sure mr krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question can you prove you are real or are we just a figment of someone's imagination are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement this is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers and i'm sure that is just fine with him br br open your eyes </s>

<s> although i love this movie i can barely watch it it is so real so i put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers i remembered it vividly but just wanted to see if i could find something i hadn't seen before i didn't that's because it's so real to me br br another user wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary i'm all for that it's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about midnight cowboy may not have been born when it was released they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in at a later time i'll be just as ruinously frank i am 82-years-old if you're familiar with some of my other comments you'll be aware that i was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years and also have appeared in film  you'd never recognize me even if you were familiar with my night-club persona do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film you bet i do br br and am not the least bit ashamed if you haven't run-into some of them it's your loss  but there's a huge chance you have but just didn't know it so many moms dads sons and daughters could surprise you it should be no secret many actors actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of midnight cowboy who is to judge i can name several current big-time stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there i make no judgment because these are humans just as we all are  love courage kindness compassion intelligence humility you name the attributes they are all there no matter what the package looks like br br the trivia about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of ratzo is a gem  he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles  how do you think he gets his input i can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money although the nightclub i last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street looking to make a pick-up br br this should be no surprise today although it's definitely action in hollywood and other cities large and small wake-up and smell the roses they smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue br br some of the users thought joe buck had been molested by his grandma although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend i didn't find any incidence of that believe-it-or-not kids haven't always had their own rooms  because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom whose business hoffman may have begged for change on the streets but some of the users point-out that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy  his actual salary would surprise you i think he was robbed no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie the end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hip br br i also did not find any homosexuality between ratzo and joe  they were clearly opposites unappealing to one another they found a much purely higher relationship  true friendship if you didn't understand that at the end of the movie then you've wasted your time joe's bewilderment but unashamed devotion was apparent yes voight deserved an oscar for this role  one that john wayne could never pull-off and he was as handsome in his youth br br hoffman is hoffman  you expect fireworks he gave them superbly wayne got his oscar every character in this film was beautifully defined  if you don't think they are still around you are mistaken the party  attend some of the raves younger people attend if you can get in look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs  you'll see every outrageous personality br br brenda viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times if you were shocked by her brilliant acting thinking this isn't real look at today's ladies who live on the brink of disrepute and are admired for it br br the brutality joe displayed in robbing the old guy unfortunately is also a part of life you don't have to condone it but it's not too much different than any violence joe pointedly named his purpose  in that situation i'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it that's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break-through one which i do not watch i get heartbroken for both br br john schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye-opener waldo salt didn't write from clairvoyance anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history and should be proud for the honesty of it perhaps only in america can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations while other movie-makers make no compunction in presenting it to

<s> what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come it wasn't because hollywood was against art or creativity the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds br br the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar-winning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a best picture freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals the point about freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of hammerstein or lerner don't have to tell or even relate to the stories what's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film br br an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being singin in the rain and the band wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story the words don't fit the plot but the routines fit the show so when gene kelly sings i got rhythm he hasn't even got a girl yet but the way it's done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point an american in paris also uses the rule-breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron's character br br and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades minnelli's colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red during oscar levant and georges guetary's meeting in the café a few more vibrant shades are introduced then during the first musical number by strauss minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the picture's colour scheme for most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people however in some numbers such as tra-la-la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated br br the achilles heel of an american in paris is its story i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero even if you don't mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances compare this to singin in the rain which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set-pieces as an american in paris but it has a winning storyline singin in the rain was overlooked at the 1952 oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all-encompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear-jerking but like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show </s>

<s> creep is a new horror film that without a doubt will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous it has many genuine shock-moments a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension what it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but to tell you the truth that didn't bother me for one second when the end-credits start to roll there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director writer christopher smith in his debut seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the creep in the london subway the story revolves on the young and haughty kate who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney who's in town to present his new film she falls asleep in the subway misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills kidnaps people to experiment upon even experienced homeless people security guards or sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster i really dug the creep-character he's nauseating hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background i reckon this isn't very original and i'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content but i forgive smith and i think it's better this way than going over the top completely jeepers creepers style that particular film started out great as well but as soon as the creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort the obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore there's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up as well as the sound effects are very convincing the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used there also is some acting-talent present in this film with franka potenta run lola run returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film anatomie creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and christopher smith definitely is a director i'll keep an eye on make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film </s>

<s> barbara stanwyck plays lily powers she's a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a little crummy mining town he also sells her to men she escapes to new york and literally sleeps her way to the top br br originally i had only seen the 71 minute version but it's pretty extreme--for its time nowadays it's pretty tame the movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendo--some of it comes off as pretty silly but fun today it moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen--even in 1933 there's nothing classic or monumental about this--it's just a quick gleefully dirty little film that's lots of fun it only falls apart at the end with a little moral ending that the censors demanded it comes across as unbelievable and stupid i saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it--one guy quite rightfully said no way i just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different somewhat tragic and much better ending this version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake i believe this is the only one in release--but be aware br br the acting is good--stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it way over the top she makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around there are also strong supporting performances from handsome donald cook and george brent also look for a pre-stardom john wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker fun dirty and fast i give this a 9 </s>

<s> galaxy express 999 ginga tetsudô three-nine made in 1979 directed by rintaro based on the original work by leiji matsumoto br br what little i know of the history of galaxy express 999 it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by leiji matsumoto ge999 is set in the same star wars-type of space universe as matsumoto's other famous space manga captain harlock in fact space pirate harlock and other characters from that manga including queen emeraldas and tochirô oyama make appearances in ge999 ge999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes it was aired in 1978 a year later came this anime film which isn't a sequel to the series but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie br br the story is set in unidentified star wars-type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility people of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years maybe even forever the protagonist tetsurô hoshino is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel count mecha whose entire body is made of mechanical parts kills tetsurô's mother tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body to obtain it he must travel to a far-away planet with space train galaxy express 999 however since tetsurô comes from poverty he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket by a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman maetel who bears a resemblance to his dead mother maetel offers a ticket for tetsurô on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey and so the journey begins br br i first saw this film last october about six months from now and again yesterday i feel that i must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film it seems very rushed then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series whatever the case the situations change with a fast speed and tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance i feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes br br however there's no arguing that ge999 has deserved its place as an anime classic the animation itself very faithful to the style of matsumoto's manga is detailed and beautiful to watch even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become out of date but puts many later anime films in shame the music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat old these day it was the 70's after all i have not heard any english dub of this film so i can only comment the japanese audio which is good voice actors give life to their characters most memorable ones being masako nozawa mainly known as the voice of goku through out the entire dragon ball saga as the excited and young tetsurô and masako ikeda as the calm and mysterious maetel the supporting characters are not left in shadows but also have a life of their own most memorable to me being waitress claire br br the story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours as well as for those who try to find deeper messages ge999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as tetsurô's journey from boyhood to manhood the whole film is told from his point of view so we are forced to feel what he feels i think many people can relate to tetsurô for despite the fantasy elements he is a very realistic character young hot headed awkward and naive we follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end when she reveals who and what she really is it doesn't much answer to anything maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man always close but just out of reach br br it's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between tetsurô and maetel that still awakes talking and questions and fascinates after the decades people have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends of mother and son or of two possible lovers which wakes a lot of critique since maetel's age is unknown and tetsurô hasn't even reached his puberty yet without any means to sound deep i think the best term to describe them is soul mates there is no question that the two feel devotion caring and love for each others yet it goes beyond that of friendship family and lovers i think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters the ending scene even if you already know what is going to happen is still very touching and memorable br br all in all despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes galaxy express 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like katsuhiro otomo's akira 1988 and mamoru oshii's ghost in the shell 1995 the film is directed by rintaro who had previous experience of leiji matsumoto's works as he had worked in captain harlock series later rinatro directed a wonderful looking metropolis 2001 that also questions the difference between humans and machines br br galaxy express 999 1979 is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan </s>

<s> the notorious bettie page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of america bettie page played by gretchen mol was one of the first sex icons in america the type of modeling bettie page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a u s senate investigation in the 1950s br br walking out of the film all i could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s you can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage questioned in the notorious bettie page seems almost childlike and innocent most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when bettie page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals i find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography it was very tastefully done br br to be honest i was pretty impressed with the notorious bettie page i found the film to be very well done and interesting the movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in america gretchen mol looks just like bettie page and gives a very fine performance i also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s br br my only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been i looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the toronto film festival also the ending was pretty tame and i was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about bettie page's life where the film left off those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially gretchen and the writing was good br br mary harron who directed american psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of the notorious bettie page i feel that mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like psycho bettie page is a character study and a fine one at that harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters she is a very talented director who i hope will be around for many years to come br br bottom line the notorious bettie page is definitely worth a look it's a very interesting story that shows how far america as well as the world has come in terms of pornography the film also provides a fine performance by gretchen mol who literally nails the role of bettie page on the head and top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands sadly this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but i think it's worth checking out br br moviemanmenzel's final rating for the notorious bettie page is a 8 10 it's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in american history </s>
<s> here's my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well br br the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con it's like the grifters but without that film's level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouse's lines  the way she reads them  sound as if they're inner monologue or narration which they aren't with the arrival of mantegna things pick up br br the dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones don't it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words he's far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality what's more strange is that other than this the film doesn't look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowed br br i wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines  or even play characters speaking play lines  but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines it's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work that doesn't mean the movie is bad  it isn't it's often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middle br br it's standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room i'll admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting she'd write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end however br br and from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones  the little learner ones  to be the most fun we're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is br br we see the ending coming and then we didn't see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didn't see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling br br i'm going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again  james foley did him better br br </s>

<s> nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that's been vilified at the us box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of kurt russell's career br br i have my reasons br br firstly when you read negative reviews of this film they usually start with the wooden nature of russell's interpretation of todd the eponymous soldier i'm going to start here too with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting i've seen russell pull off todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense ptsd  this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now br br the portrayal is spot on todd is withdrawn uncommunicative and a loner he suffers from irrational anxiety  keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger his hyper-focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within  there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed not cleaning up the cut or the blood many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote  not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later br br todd's dialog is spartan to say the least  the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence fear and discipline we are told always fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by keeping him ready to react on a knife edge discipline to hold him in check through his fear to overcome it and perform tactically the inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from nielsen's sandra  but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat  the trembling represents him suppressing his fight flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled his movement and vision restricted  fear and discipline indeed br br then there is the subtext of his abandonment twice in fact  so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms 40 of the unemployed are ex-military in our world in his it can only be worse russell quickly picks up the mantle of mace's responsibility to his wife and child  desperately in need of a mission even one with such a high likelihood of his death br br then there is the military subtext too  the conflict between busey's church and the hotshot from hq mekum mekum's new men are faster stronger more accurate and aggressive any one of them could pound todd into the ground  but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them an incentivized todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit  sent in without support cover or reconnaissance it is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership br br there are many other subtle themes when a film is shot and scripted so minimally it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root watch soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you </s>

<s> in christian duguay's movie hitler the rise of evil hitler's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration it is quite natural for a hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book i believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie making it more interesting we should not forget that this movie is not a documentary who cares how did his dog died anyway br br throughout the movie hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals but he was not portrayed as a super-villain but more like an ambitious politician i believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective yes he was a little mad and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in inglorious bastards i believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts br br the flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators even though the movie's focus was around hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers discussions of people and the songs in a jewish cabaret also society's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited struggles of journalist fritz gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him br br another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for jews in the beginning of the movie some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial all of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of jews br br in conclusion hitler the rise of evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all if you can stand directors that change history for cash it is an interesting movie reflecting hitler's personality in a successful way </s>

<s> mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story everyone probably has one and this is writer-director yasmin ahmad's story of hers with a boy called mukhsin we know that her movies have been semi-autobiographical of sorts having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty mukhsin is no different and probably the most polished ad confident work to date though i must add as a personal bias that sepet still has a special place in my heart br br our favourite family is back  pak atan mak inom orked and kak yam though this time we go back to when orked is age 10 the characters are all younger from the movies we've journeyed with them from rabun to gubra and here sharifah amani's sisters sharifah aryana and sharifah aleya take on the roles of orked and mak inom respectively which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen nevermind that their not playing sibling roles the only constant it seems is kak yam played by adibah noor and even pak atan has hair on his head through mukshin the movie we come full circle with the characters and the world that yasmin has introduced us to we come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more set in the days when they're still living in their kampung revisited back in rabun where orked attends a chinese school and packs some serious combination of punches and you wonder about that burst of energy in gubra well she had it in her since young the perennial tomboy and doted child of the family she prefers playing with the boys in games rather than mindless masak-masak with the girls and favourite outings include going with the family to football matches br br the arrival of a boy called mukhsin mohd syafie naswip to the village provides a cool peer for orked to hang out and do stuff with  cycling through the villages climbing trees flying kites and as what is desired to be explored the crossing of that line between friendship and romance both beautiful emotions br br mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story and bring about laughter because some of the incidents we would have experienced it ourselves and sometimes serve as a throwback to our own recollection of childhood in short those scenes screamed fun we observe the life in a typical kampung where some neighbours are very nice while others the nosy parkers and rumour mongers spreading ill gossip stemming from envy there are 2 additional family dynamics seen one from an immediate neighbour and the other from mukhsin's own both of which serve as adequate subplots and contrast to orked's own br br as always yasmin's movies are filled with excellent music and for mukhsin it has something special the song hujan as penned by her father as well as ne me quitte pas aptly used in the movie given that the yasmin's movies to date have been centred around the same characters the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone or when watched and pieced together makes a compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like interracial romance love and forgiveness fans will definitely see the many links in mukhsin back to the earlier movies while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events like that pudgy boy who steals glances at orked br br and speaking of whys parts of mukhsin too is curiously open which probably is distinctive of yasmin's style or deliberately left as such i thought that as a story about childhood recollected from memory then there are details which will be left out for sure and subtly i felt that mukhsin exhibited this perfectly with not so detailed details and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the two br br another highly recommended movie and a rare one that i feel is suitable for all ages  bring along your kid brother or sister </s>

<s> i've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini-series planet earth narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough nevertheless whether it was screened down here in australia or not i never caught up with it and when i happened upon the opportunity to see earth 2007   a feature-length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen i jumped at the chance the theatre was basically empty just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me and it was as though i had not only the big screen to myself but indeed the entire planet earth for 90 minutes i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film awesome in its scope and yet painfully intimate at times earth is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction br br though the film directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether indeed there is not a human in sight instead we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world to experience the resilience and also the fragility of life on earth i hear that the original mini-series which ran for eleven episodes delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems but i think that here the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact i can't remember the last time that i felt so inspired and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals anthropomorphising them to an extent we are suddenly able to appreciate the human side of each species and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy br br earth is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life-saving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator-prey interactions though occasionally perhaps to cater towards a younger audience the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature and the raw instinct that fuels these animals final hopeless efforts at survival there's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt both in the slow-motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey the result of a single fateful misstep or the majestic mid-air leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species br br aside from these main stories we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes of course entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles via some astonishing high-definition time-lapse photography throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show and only 90 minutes to show it consequently earth left me thirsting for more and fortunately i now have approximately eleven hours more as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd box-set for planet earth uplifting and tear-jerking awe-inspiring and heartrending earth is a truly magnificent documentary experience and it might just be my favourite film of 2007 </s>

<s> a surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia there's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes but it works the scares are very subtle not the jump-cut scares that seem to populate most recent asian horror films the way the scares are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in the uninvited aka 4 inyong shiktak directed by su-leon lee but this isn't nearly to the same caliber the film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological it's not perfect but it does what it's supposed to do i would recommend checking it out if you get a chance </s>

<s> i am not going to lie despite looking interesting i watched the notorious bettie page because i had heard and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film that gretchen mol got naked in it i have never been a fan of mol but i cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes yes that may be perverted but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be br br the film chronicles bettie page's mol life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the south and onto her new life in new york she wants to be an actress but she has to pay bills too after taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach page slowly becomes a modeling sensation and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs br br i feel the briefness of the film just over ninety minutes is both a curse and blessing for it on one hand the film never overstays its welcome you get to know page within a few short minutes and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back but it curses the film as well because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on she just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film you just sit there and attempt to absorb it all and more just comes right at you it feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film it begs for longer sequences and begs more for even longer explanations it does not feel rushed it just does not feel all there br br another bit of a fumble although a bit more of a curiosity is the use of colour throughout the film the majority is in black and white but frequently splashes and sequences of colour do emerge but while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white it gets confusing and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on br br while it may fumble a bit with the actions the film stays dead-on with its themes page who i know little to nothing about is played off innocently and her world is exactly the same save for a few shady characters during her teenage years everyone she encounters is an innocent and everything she does has an innocence to it i never thought i would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved but here it truly is something to marvel at all at once it is beautiful and innocent even the most sexually perverted moments in the film albeit tame compared to today's standards have an innocent and angelic feeling to them there is just something about the way mol's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films it just feels so natural and so wondrous that if there were any reason to watch the film it would be to see the spectacular depictions of mol's body as she plays bettie page br br the other reason is mol herself as page she exemplifies that 1950's southern belle everyone knows or can at least imagine despite her profession she is still a normal person and still looks at herself as being religious mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky-cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950's she plays her with such matter-of-factness that you would be hard-set not to think that mol was actually bettie page herself br br unfortunately the supporting cast have very little moments to shine and are totally overshadowed by mol's wonderful performance none of them do anything particularly pleasing and none of them really have that same strength in their role as mol does this is not really the fault of the actors but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with many of them are totally recognizable such as oscar-nominee david strathairn in a role a little too close to one of his better performances sarah paulson recent golden globe nominee for studio 60 on the sunset strip and character actor lili taylor but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay none of these characters are really developed and they really just stand as character cut-outs who mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance br br really this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity and for gretchen mol's excellent performance of bettie page everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story this film would have been a much better biographical film as it stands it is just a vehicle for mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress br br 7 10 </s>

details she replied when you first see fagin now he is cooking himself dinner you read that dickens looked at her expecting a sign of recognition instead the lady looked confused i read he was at the fireplace but i must have skimmed the passage dickens smiled as though he was brilliant he is cooking a pork sausage for his dinner a what she exclaimed he's eating pork my dear see  he's not a good

<s> by 1945 and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces errol flynn’s hold over u s box office had started to decline so in spite of the increased burden of waning looks he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler the first of these was a good one actually – adventures of don juan 1948 – but it also proved to be his last big-budget hollywood starring vehicle the rest of his sword-wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim 1950 the master of ballantrae 1953 and the dark avenger 1955 in france for adventures of captain fabian 1951 and italy for the aborted the story of william tell 1953 and the little-seen crossed swords 1954 however hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways – albeit for a modestly-budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers ‘a’ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak… br br still the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his red-headed leading lady maureen o’hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger-than-life starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie – the pirate captain roc brasiliano a role he attacks with gusto like the black shield of falworth 1954 – a viewing of which preceded this one – against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels br br for all i know this might well have been the very first pirate movie i’ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today’s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about as i said earlier against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it’s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same nowadays the amorous persistence of the child-like indian princess alice kelley towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it – despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk 1940 and the black swan 1942 to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars – is briskly paced and reasonably engaging incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as the king’s pirate 1967 with doug mcclure br br for what it’s worth the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and as a matter of fact against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly-thought out “pirates of the golden age movie collection” set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer’s girl 1950 with yvonne de carlo doule crossbones 1951 with donald o’connor and yankee buccaneer 1952 with jeff chandler value for money perhaps but so far i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk’s mutiny 1952 the afore-mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga 1961 </s>

<s> all of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just don't get it this film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker karel zeman if you want to know what i'm talking about i suggest you get any of zeman's films such as the fabulous world of jules verne baron munchausen journey to the beginning of time or on the comet if you are unable to locate a film then read the reviews in amg they will explain the processes used if one were to look at zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci fi fantasy films of the time viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers styles to the standard technologies of the day because both zemen and hines do not compute they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job it isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow i thought that the creatures were also quite good also considering how they were made hines took a great gamble and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual cg work regarding the actors i think hines also took a page from zemen's book in that many of zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first but became much more engaging as the film and action went on it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library i will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it </s>
<s> definitely spoilers in this review i adore american gothic and have done since i first saw it late at night when it first aired on ch4 in the uk when i was 14 the comparisons made to stephen king are just about right it's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters best of all and the reason i love it so much is it had the guts to never be black and white lucas buck though lacking any conscience often works by as he says giving people enough rope to hang themselves with his manipulation only works because of other people's weak morals caleb though generally a thoughtful kind insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father none of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in the plague sower not only that but having gail the closest thing to a mother figure for caleb not only sleep with but fall in love with lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it i'm a huge buffy fan but when that show tried to go really dark in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it's humorous side and didn't commit fully to its ideas ag shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show and still have a hell of laugh doing it br br i can't even think about why it was cancelled as i'll just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all so much rubbish on tv and good original shows get kicked around and stamped on thanks to the emergence of dvd at least i can see the show in it's entirety yes some of the visuals look dated now but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines the actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work br br the only reason why i think someone may not like this show is that it isn't like the x-files where there are cases to solve or lost where there's huge unanswered questions it's pretty obvious from the get go that lucas buck has some kind of evil powers and that the show is all about fighting for caleb's soul so this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown truth to find yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects with some such as the truth about gails parents getting resolved but unlike lost and x-files this show isn't about trying to find out more facts about what's going on imo it's all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of trinity personally i would just get such a kick out of seeing lucas turn every situation to his advantage br br all in all the main thing i have to say is check it out i'm pretty certain most fantasy horror fans will love it also even though it got cancelled all characters have arcs and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure the only hanging thread i felt was dr matt having him not be in the final episodes is strange br br i would have done anything for a second season but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some tv execs appear to be i should be glad this wonderful show got made at all </s>
<s> i don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said but this is one of the best series ever it was a great shame when it was canceled and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again the good news is that it is out on dvd i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character and all actors were very good it is a shame that the network did not continue it shaun cassidy this is a masterpiece anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it must do so you will not be disappointed my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television she is 20 is becoming very interested and will soon be a fan she finds it very twisted and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired br br this show rocks </s>

<s> the year 1995 when so many people talked about the great premiere of braveheart by mel gibson also saw another very fine yet underrated movie on scottish history rob roy although it is a very different film especially due to the historical period the story is set in rob roy has much in common not only with marvelous braveheart but also with the very spirit of epic movies br br it is a film that discusses similar themes like fight for dignity courage honor revenge family being a key to happiness it also leads us to the very bliss of scottish highlands where the human soul finds its rest being surrounded by all grandeur of nature robert roy macgregor liam neeson the main character is a true hero so universal in epics sort of scottish robin hood who struggles to lead his people out of oppression imposed by cold hearted lords although he worsens his situation through the acts has to suffer a lot two things stay in his mind undeniably honor that he is given by himself and love to his woman mary macgregor jessica lange that leads him to unexpected events br br except for the interesting content and quite vivid action the movie is filled with truly stunning visuals this factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves an insight into artistic images for me the most splendid scene was in the highlands when rob roy tells his boys what honor really means then he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman the scene he escapes marguis of montrose john hurt to the waterfall is also worth a look as a stunning visual br br of course there is some graphic violence like in the duel for instance but i don't think that this violence would be as harmful as in many other modern films its justification is like any other epic's bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it the most disturbing scene for me was the rape done on rob roy's wife by the villain of the story archibald cunningham tim roth it's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away however all the rest is o k yet there is one aspect that made me really love this movie the performances br br all the cast do perfect jobs from the leading lian neeson who fits very well to the role of tall brave strong scottish man to the supporting cast of brian cox who portrays wicked killearn a silent witness of terrible acts who feels comfortable with the evil of war jessica lange is very fine as mary macgregor and has some of the most beautiful moments in the film there is chemistry between ms lange and mr neeson in many of their scenes john hurt one of the best british actors does a terrific job as marguis of montrose a corrupted man for whom money is the aim in itself achieved by any means i like that calmness of his portrayal but the real villain is played by tim roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character archibald  a man who mocks love who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter but like in any good epic this exceptional evil must find its end br br and one more aspect the musical score such memorable and sentimental tunes that are bound to sound in the ears for long the final moment touched me to tears not only because of the beauty it conveys but because i deeply combined these blissful tunes with the grandeur of locations scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this movie reminded me of that permanent effect it was as if my second journey to scotland br br rob roy is a very nice movie very well directed photographed and acted it perhaps does not equal braveheart with its spectacular sets and crowds of extras in battle scenes but it is a fairly long film with much attention placed on one very significant feature a cinema should have stunning entertainment combined with heartfelt education i really enjoyed that film do not hesitate to call it metaphorically highlands of entertainment and rate it 9 10 </s>

<s> i was lucky enough to attend a screening in stockholm for this elegantly expressed enjoyable and thought-provoking film with romance as the heaviest weapon in its arsenal paris je t'aime boldly plunges into love in paris navigating the different forms in eighteen separate quartiers but without pouting parisiennes and saccharine formulas its goldmine undoubtedly stems from frustration on the directors parts  frustration over only having 5-10 minutes of screen time  thereby you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party br br debating whether or not i should review all 18 segments i reached the conclusion that it would be merely redundant and long-winded instead simply rest assured that each director graces the film with their eccentric styles and skills and certainly you'll find your favourite although gus van sant cannot resist the temptation to be introspective his les marais is one of the better contributions even sneaking in a well-placed kurt cobain reference the coen brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in paris a scene with a muted but emotionally transparent steve buscemi deadpan humour and clever camera angles that surely generated the most laughter in my theatre and perhaps rightly so br br in this way all story lines are exquisitely unique  filtered through the minds of different directors  but the one that deviates the most from the rest is vincenzo natali's quartier de la madeleine a dark horror-gothic love starring elijah wood as a lost tourist in the backstreets of paris in the night who meets a vampiress with a black-and-white format but blood-red colour contrast that seems to incongruously bleed off screen it nearly becomes a pastiche of sin city  a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film br br yet my single favourite segment was faubourg saint-denis by tom tykwer but i think i was conditioned to think so given that i went in the theatre with him as my favourite and nudged my friend in the side saying finally that's my favourite director here nevertheless it cannot be denied that tykwer delivers a lovely segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend portman  for once not annoying that she breaks up with him and he reflects on their relationship as is tywker's style the story is dizzyingly fast-paced kinetic and repetitive featuring screaming and running lola rennt making it the most adrenaline-pumping segment in paris je t'aime and possibly also the most touching once tywker starts wielding his most powerful tool  music br br to fill the negative account clearly not all directors manage as touching as tywker van sant cohens coixet and dépardieu sylvain chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by carving out a truly disposable segment in which a little boy retells the story of how his parents met they are two lonely mimes this part is so in-your-face french and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers suwa also directs a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually haggard-looking juliette binoche whom mourns the loss of her son nothing else happens finally the wrap-up and interweaving of the 18 stories in the end feels somewhat rushed and half-hearted br br yet paris je t'aime truly spoils you with quality for all the other stories are well-crafted with crisp acting and amusing writing it is certainly one of the highlights of 2006 not saying much i suppose and a very personal film in the sense that it is unavoidable to pick a favourite and a least favourite highly recommended both to mainstream of pretentious heh audiences br br 8 out 10 </s>

<s> i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up show off sexy models and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window with that said the bourne series has been fantastic doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly this is not the sci-fi absurdity that was bond before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out with director paul greengrass taking over what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment the bourne ultimatum in what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised br br once again bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story he is assumed to be the mole only pamela landy she who was on the case to find him in supremacy knows that he can't be the one bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer the film then becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him br br in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression this is not a detriment at all however as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight between bourne and the cia's second asset alone the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own but when they finally meet up we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see also rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films we instead get around three small scale road races just as intense but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony br br after five years of waiting we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that

intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox's character from the first two films took matters into his own hands needing a role in that mold we are given a nice turn from david strathairn like cox he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing even the little guys do a wonderful job like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything albert finney as a man from bourne's past and possibly key to his origin and edgar ramirez as one of the cia's operatives sent to take bourne out ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen identity karl urban and martin csokas supremacy he doesn't talk much if at all but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino br br in the end one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them his skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts rather than feel like over production his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action let's also credit cinematographer oliver wood who shot all three bourne films he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them </s>
<s> absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch i highly recommend this movie her performance in my opinion was academy award material the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or dvd they are ignoring a very good movie but universal has little regard for its library on dvd which is sad if you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available anywhere br br a 10 </s>

<s> i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness the film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the us into the war paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family he's a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture bette davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop running br br the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems while this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today in particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true it sounded more like anti-fascism speeches than the voices of real children they were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them though he had no discernible accent br br it's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesn't sound true to life the story was based on the play by his lover lillian hellman and the basic story idea and plot is good but the dialog is just bad at times overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments but that's really about all </s>

<s> this one's a romp many trek fans don't rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones but this one is so well executed for what it is so successful as pure entertainment it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes no matter what mood i'm in several well known future movies westworld and tv shows the more bland fantasy island took their cue from the premise of this episode then of course the tng show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology beautifully filmed especially evident in the restored version and on dvd and directed it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to it's odd that no animal life even insects seems to exist here how are flowers pollinated for example but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past kirk has a people-heavy past it turns out as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories sulu even finds an old-style police revolver adding to his collection of swords no doubt br br by this point in the trek series halfway thru the first season the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we'd come to know over the many proceeding years here we get to really see them relax converse and work together to figure out this episode's puzzle the strong narrative is a mystery again of sorts and the audience is along for the ride as kirk friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them it's almost whimsical following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue the enterprise had it's suggested just completed a harrowing mission then dr mccoy is killed by a knight on horseback yes this is dr mccoy's final episode just kidding but it's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story mccoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and like the best trek episodes the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic more desperate tempo of action and suspense this is all signaled by kirk's resolute response to sulu who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after mccoy's death  kirk will get to the bottom of all this come what may br br but it doesn't get much easier for kirk what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet yet this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness with another of kirk's past acquaintances this episode runs the gamut of all human experience rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet it's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what's happened as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy sci-fi series with similar plot lines unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there and there actually is a subtext to the story  that we humans need to work off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion or we just don't function in a normal natural way also note the appearance of the very cute yeoman barrows and the sudden absence of yeoman rand who did not return until the first trek movie in 79 i believe that after this episode even more trek fans couldn't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters but i leave this episode with a final perhaps tantalizing thought if mccoy was killed verified by spock how do we know it was our real mccoy who beamed back up to the ship perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with data </s>

<s> deliverance is a stunning thriller every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach-churningly frightening though it is not a horror movie it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film the very thought of being a normal red-blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies is surely the worst nightmare of 99 9 of the world's population it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory but john boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity with so many films you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl but with deliverance you come away praying to god that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through br br four city guys  ed jon voight lewis burt reynolds drew ronny cox and bobby ned beatty  head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon-to-be-dammed river the guys are riding the rapids in pairs and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland here they fall foul of two local woodlanders bill mckinney and herbert coward who tie ed to a tree while one of them strips and rapes bobby instructing him perversely to squeal like a pig lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis being a fair archer kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest under great emotional stress the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area but they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river br br deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale but even more powerful and disturbing as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters though all the performances are remarkable one must take particular note of beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down the film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film straw dogs  both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape with nobody to rely on other than themselves this truly is suspenseful film-making at its finest </s>

<s> this movie surprised me not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style normally i am very careful when this is claimed there is only one john woo and til this day there hasn't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action the fact that moon child would feature a vampire convinced me even more how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires sounds promising and interesting the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow it takes it's time to set the mood this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes but moon child isn't an action movie it is a drama about friendship and loyalty the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends the only problem i had was with the plot a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip example when one member of the gang dies very dramatic moment alexander wang sees kei hyde drinking blood of one of the attackers without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends aren't together anymore also without a proper reason given son alexander wang and sho gackt have to kill each other i know that this is done to add some serious drama because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful but it just is the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere </s>

<s> i should say at the outset there are many many things i love about forbidden planet and yes i certainly consider it a classic science-fiction film for many reasons but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion no less an authority than leonard maltin says forbidden planet is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre ambitious without a doubt intelligent depends on what part of the film you're talking about it certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point at a cost of nearly 2 million this was 1956 remember mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects charming is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here even the dreaded monster from the id is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the disney people unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8 when i see the various sets and take note of the art design models costumes etc i am reminded of nothing so much as the wizard of oz  with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless forbidden planet is wonderful to look at the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated matte paintings of planets and space in the background and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth it's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you'd ever see the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible but then we get to the actors darn it the performances are almost uniformly awful though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance it's lugubrious at times a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j j adams and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film he seems to instinctively know thirty years ahead of time that his true forte lay in comedy as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines every forced reaction whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation looks right out of a high school play anne francis also very young fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up alta morbius now there's a name for you unfortunately even at this early age anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in butterfield 8  there is a good story here buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman's cookie  ship's cook holliman turns in a horrendous performance too i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school based on shakespeare's the tempest  the story of a dead race the krell and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about forbidden planet  and for good reason for a few minutes here and there you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists conception of the krell underground complex is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings you'll have to decide that on your own oh and of course there's robby the robot every 1950's ten-year-old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like he's funny in places so forbidden planet to me is a very very mixed bag it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and tv shows that followed not least of which was star trek  but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it's more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again </s>

<s> not only do the storylines in the sopranos engage audiences from all over but i think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting not even you gary can dispute that claim james gandolfini who plays the lead-man tony soprano has become in this viewer's opinion one of the hollywood elites as far as acting in a television series goes i wouldn't go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino or at least not just yet he however does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano in the years since 1999 gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos that today he is considered to be among the best in the business and it's not just him the sopranos fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco edie falco michael imperioli dominic chianese and the late nancy marchand who played tony's dreadful mother at this point in the show's existence it's being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so the first two seasons were extraordinary violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarily done the third season was great but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 season 4 which wrapped up right before new-years was the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it was despite a dry-spell i still found it season 4 of the sopranos to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately i've been noticing a trend in good new television shows examples of this six feet under the shield curb your enthusiasm and oz which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year to get back to my point though to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year no less is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers the sopranos ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit to close i'd like to say the sopranos is the real deal folks for the average mature viewer 17 and above who enjoys drama and doesn't mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity you might want to check out the sopranos if you get the chance trust me in that it will be well worth the time </s>

<s> which do you think the average person would know more less about iranian cinema or iranian football interestingly the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahi's latest film entitled offside a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual's right to extend that courtesy if and when they'd like to the odd thing is you don't come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema unless it's an education in panahi's controversial style but you do come away feeling enlightened that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it br br i can remember the 2006 world cup i'm sure many people can it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic needless to say i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain 82 when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeria br br anyone in britain that was watching the bbc's broadcast of the iran  mexico game both nations first of the tournament may remember that at the top of the show the bbc's football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match it went something like we've seen giants germany england argentina and holland play but now we get to see mexico and iran battle it out the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore it's a shame because there are people and films like offside present them who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their well-being to achieve it and it's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem inferior when there are others who'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage br br when immediately thinking of the words iran football and world cup my mind flies back to the france 98 game between said nation and america here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around iran's famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing iran's victory as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they defeat a western power or enemy at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in br br a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 indian film lagaan in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket similalry 2005's the game of their lives sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the 1950 world cup the differences between these films and offside are immense offside is looking at a situation behind a state's mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men may not will but may use during the game the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman's right to see the game all together  it is no wonder panahi's film was itself banned in iran br br but panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match panahi pays special attention to the title of his film offside which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an attacker is caught trying to gain an advantage in the field of play the parallels run with the womens position in the film as these advancing supposedly without right individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team that being the state itself br br i think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that i've seen it's a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo-realist aura to it all the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong-doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons i've mentioned shows a distinct level of callous either that or you work in the iranian government </s>

<s> watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year it wasn't at all a bad movie certainly not average but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional which perhaps as based on frank miller's comic book was the right decision to go with but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings while i would probably re-watch fire and ice before 300 again they both aroused that similar feeling  the exception this time being naturally that it's frank frazetta the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics collaborating with director ralph bakshi in what isn't typical hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans br br what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day is the possible cons mentioned before and maybe that you will see something somewhat unique fire and ice isn't even the only bakshi rotoscoped feature but it's possibly the most fluid if not quite my personal favorite of the few he made and he and his team create a whole striking world that's part pre-historic part out-of-this-world fantastic and part medieval and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds the skies and grounds there's a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design bakshi went as far as to say it's more frazetta than him this may be true but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide how they rotoscoped that amazes me br br i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it if you're already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a damsel or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada so suffice to say it's about well fire against ice with characters named nekron and darkwolf the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance and teegra the typical hottie who's almost too perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure what the plot does do as an asset is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle like when the ogres are hunting after teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes and per usual for bakshi he conjures up some craziness if not quite his usual inspired lunacy in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material if you've seen wizards you'll understand what i mean to a lesser extent br br so if you're an animation buff seek this out right away for some old-school i e 1980s action and incredible design for everyone else it's good not great as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension with some alterations 300 </s>

<s> i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007's films if 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales films that portray test challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this identification is rather broad i think that there are a handful of films released this year such as 3 10 to yuma eastern promises american gangster no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery before the devil knows you're dead is a deviously stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time the legendary sidney lumet who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller br br it's one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers namely blood simple and fargo and quentin tarantino we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ridiculously wrong and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time sizzling sharp thick and precariously depressing kelly masterson's screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplay br br but the film has much more going for it than just it's delectably sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost the picture looks and feels outstandingly well sidney lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great editing is top-notch combining the sizzling drama-thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly and vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwell br br the screenplay does its part and of course lumet does his part but at the film's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading-man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar-winning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed broken manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater grander actors here he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it's watching actors and then there's albert finney such a supple opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they're middle-aged men and yet despite this it is clear how finney's father favours hawke's younger weaker brother also on the topic of the cast the two supporting female characters  wives of the brothers  also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei whose looks just get better and better as the years go by br br this film isn't revolutionary these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers and it's very easy to imagine them directing this film but for a film that treads familiar ground it simply excels lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to masterson's brilliantly vivid intense and morbidly depressing first-time screenplay the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman hawke and finney but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful resonant intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years </s>

<s> twelve monkeys is odd and disturbing yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time it cleverly jumps between future and the past and the story it tells is about a man named james cole a convict who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996 at first cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr kathryn railly who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey goines the insane son of a famous scientist being provocative and somehow so sensible dealing with and between reason and madness the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films br br the story is just fantastic it's so original and so entertaining the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named la jetée 1962 which i haven't seen but i must thank the director and writer of the movie chris marker for giving such an inspiration for the writers of twelve monkeys i read a little about la jetée it's not the same story but it has the same idea so this is not just a copy of it david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling composed by paul buckmaster br br terry gilliam who we remember from monty python as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me as i really never thought him as a director type of a person i know he has directed movies before but i really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent it shouldn't be a surprise though as he does an amazing job you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python's but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing yes it is indeed odd weird bizarre and disturbing so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through it's not as heavy as you could imagine but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch despite that the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks dreams jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part though it does need concentration from the viewer after all br br what comes to acting well the movie doesn't even go wrong there the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis who probably does his best role performance yet to date now people may disagree with me as he did some fine job in for example the sixth sense as well but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well the character is very well written too yet performed even better cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself starting to question his actual time of living trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle by hardship he starts to loose his faith questioning if he can even trust or believe himself other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt stow plays the role of kathryn railly the psychiatrist of james cole who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness she somehow starts to believe cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it so i guess i'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing br br all in all twelve monkeys is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone especially for the sci-fi fans it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances especially from willis and pitt and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty it's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures i've ever seen through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride hard to explain really but that's how it is it's mind blowing </s>

<s> there has been a political documentary of recent vintage called why we fight which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during world war two by hollywood director frank capra although considered documentaries and having won oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes that said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries such as the bbc's lauded the world at war lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable they are skillfully made and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series br br rarely has something free been so worth invaluable while there are no extras on the dvds and the sound quality of the prints varies these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts the seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are prelude to war the nazis strike divide and conquer the battle of britain the battle of russia the battle of china and war comes to america br br overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern singular or the most overused graphic in the whole series a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria yet it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars the lesson of world war one avoid foreign entanglements was not applicable to world war two whose own lesson act early against dictatorships has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since korea vietnam nor iraq the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position nor will you be the last </s>

<s> canadian director vincenzo natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions br br i've been eagerly awaiting natali's follow-up and although its taken five years for him to mount another project i'm delighted to say it was worth the wait cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his control br br i don't want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it's head cypher is such a film br br morgan sullivan jeremy northam one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet is hired by the company digicorp they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars to his bewilderment they are unbelievably boring covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese br br while morgan is waiting for one seminar he runs into rita foster an impeccably cast lucy liu the definition of an ice maiden she gives him the brush-off but there is something to her he finds irresistible that's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in br br when rita turns up at another one of morgan's seminars she tells him his life is not what it appears and i'm not saying anything more about the plot to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us as well as the tortuous path that's so much fun to follow br br as with cube natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people taking them out of the familiar and basically seeing what will happen when they're thrust into the unknown and cypher follows similar patterns but it's not a carbon copy of cube it has it's own inspiration br br cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him br br one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns cypher is also on a low budget but natali economises it as much as he can allowing him to broaden the horizon and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity br br natali's direction is exceptional with a deft hand on the reins there are some amazing camera angles from above such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir br br the acting is uniformly excellent throughout jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity his performance is excellent because it's so modulated he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes from a clinical spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity br br david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black his scene is one of the best because it's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia he is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents and it's a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly acted by hewlett all he has to do is look at morgan and we're drawn into his complex mind game br br but it's lucy liu who's the scene stealer here too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect but in cypher she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove rita is an aloof guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone br br things come to a very gratifying end that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did but morgan deserves his happy ending after he's been put through the ringer like this i cheered for him in the final scene it's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes br br cypher succeeds on all counts engaging shocking always entertaining it's everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn't and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix br br a fine follow-up from natali and now i'm a committed fan of the man superb stuff </s>
<s> neatly skipping over everything from the coup in cuba to his undercover entry into bolivia part two of soderbergh's portrayal of che guevara is that of the tragic hero as with che  part one this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy so why was the film and particularly benicio del toro's performance so loudly praised at cannes br br james rocchi for instance called it a work of art that's not just the story of a revolutionary but a revolution in and of itself the guardian's peter bradshaw called it a flawed masterpiece i return to my original contention for part one  that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure and in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero role-models could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life this is the psychological hero enshrined by the great scottish essayist thomas carlyle in his seminal book heroes and hero worship heroes can be real or imaginary or somewhere in-between but should genuinely inspire us to higher goals a higher purpose compare this with the unrealistic heroes of standard western storytelling where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely-believable reward  usually everlasting love or material wealth  as if by divine studio intervention real heroes have an excess of moral courage  not lost ark dare-devilishness or james bond super-toys they rise and empower others to rise to be the best that they can be in part one che succeeds in part two he fails it is not for want of moral courage but since a not all good plans can succeed and b being human mistakes are inevitable br br guevara's intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed it is a serious miscalculation br br high in the mountains from la paz the colours are breathtaking there is an air of mise-en-scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in che  part one the u s would not allow soderbergh to film in cuba visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking red cameras this is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of 35mm film and the convenience of pure digital designed for flexibility and functionality the package weighs a mere 9 lbs shooting with red is like hearing the beatles for the first time says soderbergh red sees the way i see so organic so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena  light if che had stopped with the successful cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility that he fails in bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered not the political triumph critics will say  and with some justification  that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin-pot dictatorships his development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves and have since been used for both br br but for all its praiseworthiness the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension we stumble from one escapade to another knowing that he will eventually meet his death i found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter but the work that has gone into this  interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of guevara's ex-comrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the bolivian operations  make the film a commendable achievement it might not be top-flight entertainment but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history br br there is also another very important point in the che hero figure here it's about failure that if you try your utmost even if you fail your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage one could cynically call it a martyr complex and it is found of course in many religious figures as well but che does not sacrifice himself he does what he does best to the best of his not inconsiderate ability and so provides an example success or failure in any particular instance become mere details br br with the u s s longstanding and illegal blockade of cuba all in the name of freedom i am tempted to write that che parts 1 2 are too good to be wasted on the u s but that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid one must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders whatever its faults it rehabilitates soderbergh from the populist nonsense of oceans 11 br br but if you haven't heard of che guevara or seen part one or if you can't get past the phrase murderous marxist without frothing at the mouth i might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film the same can be said for many who have and can </s>

director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults br br despite countless disruptions veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium the copy i was sent was the pre-release screener which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack but still it boasted a few credible jump-scares some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that i've seen for some time one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up spilling her guts after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend richard grieco even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome samhain never feels mean spirited which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clichés in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven's scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them br br certainly the inclusion of the mouth-watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top as expected and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes but samhain is no soft porn movie and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce it's worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost out-perform the supposed actors of the feature which isn't much of a complement ginger lynn was at least notable if you ignore the shameful oirish accent and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics which could have been caused by the numerous problems on-set veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much-needed injections of suspense exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds br br it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending and i'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years this one is certainly worth checking out </s>

<s> attention spoilers br br first of all let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the 90's it was an amazing achievement for all those involved especially the acting of liam neeson jessica lange john hurt brian cox and tim roth michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves but alas br br it constantly and unfairly gets compared to braveheart these are two entirely different films probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland yet this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that braveheart is a better film than rob roy i like braveheart a lot but the idea of comparing it to rob roy is a little insulting to me to put quite simply i love braveheart but it is a pale shadow to how much i love rob roy here are my particular reasons br br  rob roy is about real people br br let's face it the william wallace in braveheart is not a real person he's a legend a martyr a larger than life figurehead because of this depiction he is also a perfect person never doing wrong and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land when he finally does fail it is not to his fault like jesus he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much br br the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective but it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection that is why the last temptation of christ is a better film than king of kings and that is also one of the reasons why i think rob roy is better than braveheart rob roy may be heroic and brave but he is far from perfect he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones now sure not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act but rob did the best he could and that was all you could ask of him br br rob's wife mary is also a normal ambigious person let us start though with how she looks in this film sure she's beautiful but she doesn't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show compare this with the two loves or one depending on your point of view of william wallace in braveheart now these two ladies are hot but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time especially the lay persons maybe not a fair comparison but just another example of how rob roy's attempts for accuracy are far more effective br br throughout rob roy mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion cunningham she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle but doesn't because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape such revenge would surely mean the death of rob and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice br br the villains in rob roy are equally as compelling although the enemies in braveheart are well written they are hardly original robert the bruce a man both brave and cowardly is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm should he take his claim as the king of scotland or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name bruce is the most ambigious character in braveheart but from brutus in julius ceasar to fredo in the godfather part ii these types of characters are hardly original longshanks although a compelling villain in his own right is very one dimensional he is the epidemy of evil and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace's heroism br br rob roy has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery first of all let's start with marquis of montrose he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image that he's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it see to it that i am not mocked are his favorite words to his factor he is a man obsessed with power upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure he is an evil aristocrat but in ways that make him unique br br cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in rob roy and are also roy's direct assailants callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis which includes backstabbing and trickery cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis he needs a father little does he know that the marquis is his real father therefore when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn he grabs it without even questioning it he is very much like the evil of modern man so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others br br many have criticized tim roth's performance in this film as overacting hogwash i say it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life rob roy simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail but snakes will always exist in our world br br another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll he is a true nobleman and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor he gives the world hope for the people of power hopefully people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule br br  the final duel in rob roy is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in braveheart br br one thing i get tired of is people telling me that braveheart is a better film because of the battle scenes first of all battle scenes are hardly original from spartacus to gladiator hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes braveheart has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film but they suffer from one important problem these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom br br now don't get me wrong duels are hardly original either in fact there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold it is one of the greatest scenes in film history let me explain why br br first of all the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly cunningham is effette and dangerous rob roy is strong and courageous cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword cunningham fights with quick tricky movements while roy's fighting style is more obvious br br the whole film from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half is leading up to this moment it is powerful stuff and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world when rob finally gets the upper hand literally and figuratively it is one of the greatest moments in film history rob wins because he has more to live for and his honor is more powerful than 10 cunningham's the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell freedom but hey maybe that's just me br br  rob roy is more realistic than braveheart br br i don't know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in rob roy but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns i feel that many people are bored by rob roy simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying if this is the case then read some shakesphere or put on the close-captioning rob roy is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's many of the dialogue in this film is clever but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it br br by contrast the dialogue in braveheart is hardly very interesting of course what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian this is a legend and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times this film takes place several centuries before rob roy and yet they talk like the people today thus the reason that many people like it better audiences today have become increasingly lazy and they don't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex therefore as with many epic films they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language sure it is clear that the wallace is scotish but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of aye s for acknowledgement the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound br br so do these descriptions prove that rob roy is a better film than braveheart hardly but if it proves one thing it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that braveheart is a better film than rob roy to put simply rob roy is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today's world braveheart is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic you can make a decision on what you think is better br br grade  a score  9 </s>

<s> arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives but as the tag line says arnold has yet to play the movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen controlling every aspect of life through tv and a police state it's most popular game show is the running man in which criminals are forced to survive against stalkers that live to kill them br br the movie opens with ben richards arnold leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress he is ordered by his superiors to fire on them refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help the government blames richards for the massacre earning him the name butcher of bakersfield eighteen months later richards along with two friends william laughlin koto and harold weiss mcintyre breakout of a detention zone they worked in they make their way to the underground led by mic mick fleetwood mic quickly identifies richards as the butcher of bakersfield and refuses to help him but his friend's convince him otherwise they want him to join the resistance but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name amber mendez alonso has taken his apartment knowing who he is she won't help him but he convinces her but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out br br meantime the running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill damon killian dawson the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture richards refuses to play killian threatens to use his friends instead of him so he signs the contract you'll love that part but soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure killian knows he'll be back the runners begin to make there way through the zones and fight characters that are memorable sub-zero buzz saw and many others eventually richards is joined by amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too together they find the underground and make there way back to killian and give him a farewell send off br br the running man is another one of arnold's great movies from the 80's the movie was apparently somewhat based on stephen king's book of the same name some have said that the book is better i'm sure it's not and i don't care anyway i loved the movie as in all of arnold's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from arnold and even ventura gets a couple in but without a doubt richard dawson is the standout in this film being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded the whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows hate boat among others also the cast was great besides arnold koto and alonzo don't forget professor toru tanaka jim brown ventura and sven-ole with all the reality tv nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now but i'm sure the hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the evil bush the new dvd had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one some how the aclu managed to get some of there communism into the dvd and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an arnold movie of all things blasphemy overall for any arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him you can't miss this its one of the first ones i saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day the futuristic world and humor are great overall 10 out 10 stars definitely one of his best </s>

<s> every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening though they usually aren't most modern horror movies fit into this category br br then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual they actually frighten you to a level that you've never experienced br br halloween is such a film it takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe but nearly all of them work halloween is awe-inspiring in its simplicity and terrifying as a whole br br the story is simple laurie strode jamie lee curtis is babysitting some kids on halloween night while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago of course the madman later known as michael myers begins killing the local teenage population and eventually he comes after laurie br br sounds familiar right just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore not a chance br br i think james berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of halloween because of its title halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s however while halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre it is not a member br br he has a point and for a number of reasons first and foremost it's downright terrifying whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek but most of those fail as well second there is almost no violence very little of which is bloody john carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary and he relies very little on it actually the body count is pretty low in fact one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie each gorier and more sadistic than the last he relies on ideas for scares and also skill third while some of the characters may do stupid things that sometimes seal their fate they don't do them because they're dumb the characters are real people so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots we're frightened because they're making a mistake br br one of the main reasons why halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real nothing is hard to swallow in this film there's no supernatural there's no ridiculously creative plot elements or inventive murders or whatnot instead all the set pieces and camera work save the opening sequence are simple carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action what we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us br br horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary everything has to be perfect and ideas never work twice it's a hit or miss game which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has which i'm not they'd seem primitive particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years br br acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be this is a movie about scary ideas not a movie about dramatic conflicted characters the actors act like real people not characters from a story nothing more the exception to this is whoever plays the shape or later known as michael myers it can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill but it's hard to pull off and even harder to keep people from asking why but the guy pulls it off and the result is terrifying br br this is carpenter's movie through and through he directed it co-wrote it co-produced it and wrote the chilling score of it this is a man of brilliance and his later movie the thing supports this statement though the thing is not as scary as halloween unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential as good as this film is it's not without flaws the famous opening scene is disturbing but not very scary and not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie it's not that it's bad it's just that there's no good reason to fear the shape luckily carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience while there's no intimacy in this relationship it fits the purpose we grow to know the characters but not so much that it's disheartening when they die but once the film gets to halloween night that's when carpenter kicks things into high gear and it never stops until you get to the end br br while halloween may be flawed it is only slightly so it is an immensely terrifying film and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies be warned though this movie will scare the living hell out of you </s>

<s> the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear it is a political film more than a plain entertainment jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity he really killed some one who became his corpse but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980 when he became vice president that goes along with what is being said on the internet then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the senate involved in a general investigation a woman and the senate read my lips in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign it is music and the cinema right now hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general and this film in particular to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the senate so go and watch the film it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for but no one is able to pretend it won't come the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines </s>

<s> i'm not kidding about that summary and vote the video distributors have packaged this as just another typical 80s werewolf movie but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre that you can imagine having done for the horror movie what blazing saddles did for the western i have seen plenty of comedies  good bad stupid weird etc usually walking away unimpressed and i think that comedy must be the most difficult genre for filmmakers and actors to work in  it takes just the right kind of touch to make things successful and part of that is having good ideas full moon high is bulging with good ideas  so many in fact that it can easily put the zucker abrams team of airplane and naked gun to shame one of the best of these is the very presence of ed mcmahon in a starring role as a john birch-style right-wing crackpot the jokes non-sequiturs wisecracks and word-play are literally non-stop and everything including the kitchen sink has been thrown in the ironic tone is very similar to that of back to the future br br some people i e almost every reviewer here must have been turned off by the spirit of anarchy here but i almost died of laughter and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of insane situation will transpire next since b-movie extraordinaire larry cohen had not made a straight comedy before this one gets the sense that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his collaborators could think of if mel brooks had made this the critics would have labelled it a comic masterpiece but because it was made by cohen it has been dismissed as schlock critical reviews have called this movie too silly silly what is a comedy supposed to be  serious anyway i laughed out loud more for this movie than any other i can think of cohen makes fun of everyone  himself included with plenty of references to his usual brand of low-rent film-making he and the actors must have had a complete blast making this br br the humor is very mel brooks-ish and anyone who loves jewish humor or watches a lot of b-movies especially horror will love this trust me the movie isn't too hard to find and as long as you accept it for what it is  a roller-coaster of belly laughs with no pretense of social value whatsoever  then you'll truly enjoy it br br one sidenote this movie should somehow go down in history as the one thing bob saget ever starred in albeit briefly that was actually funny </s>

<s> kazan's early film noir won an oscar some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism and rate it very highly i can almost see where they are coming from but i prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a long-forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi-documentary fashion pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of new orleans and it is up to a military doctor widmark and a city detective douglas to apprehend the main carrier palance the film is moody shot in stark black and white and makes very good use of locations widmark is wonderful as usual forget the symbolism crime equals disease and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase it is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived post wwii through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher for those who will be watching this for the first time sit tight for the big chase at the end it is something else and frankly i don't know how they filmed some of it i can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie </s>

<s> to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet i have a friendly warning don't watch la casa dell'orco expecting any demons at all because you won't find them here this film is not a third installment to the demons series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever except the fact that lamberto bava directed them as a matter of fact michele soavi's the church is also known an unofficial demons 3 and it's a deceptive title in that case as well so go figure it is obvious that due to the demons films success they tried to deceive the audience with misleading titles even though it is obvious that this is a disconnected story having said that i think it's unfair on the other hand to say that la casa dell'orco is not worth the look honestly the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations i thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole nevertheless i think it's fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate lucio fulci's the house by the cemetery of course that's just a speculation i have but i think i have my valid evidences for instance in both films paolo marco is the man of the family in both films there's an irritating little son named bobby in both films the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty-something who seems to be the only one to see that there's something really wrong in the new house and in both films there's something really really wrong going on in the basement i'm sorry but i can relate both films very easily and i'm not saying that as an accusation for the contrary my point is that those who enjoyed the house by the cemetery are probably going to enjoy this movie as well keeping in mind of course that la casa dell'orco is far less pretentious less scary not nearly as atmospheric but the formula is still there br br in la casa dell'orco charel her husband tom and their little son bobby go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle situated in the heart of an italian villa called trifiri leaving aside the beauty of the place shortly after their arrival charel starts to have the feeling that she has been there before which is impossible considering that she had never been to trifiri before sadly charel can't get over her déjà vu and the worst part is that her visions come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her tom who is not a very patient guy to begin with advices her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation however the woman's visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy suddenly turn into a living nightmare the old nightmare from charel's childhood becomes real and this time she won't be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first br br as it is expected the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence it is hard to fill an hour and a half this means that la casa dell'orco offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character walking around the castle for several minutes reviving the images of her childhood and nothing else it gets rather tedious from time to time but overall it's nothing serious like many italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties this movie is pretty stylish and effective but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments that make the movie unforgettable in a way for instance the part in which charel is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like i would have expected she strikes back against him by punching him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac the funniest thing however is the fact that two minutes later they're a happy couple again as if punching each other like that was the most natural thing in the world i know it's silly but i myself found it absolutely hilarious the ogre which is obviously the villain of the story looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let's face it a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit it's twice as welcomed it reminded me of michael jackson in thriller but much more natural and human of course but if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that i mentioned before the music composed by simon boswell is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension so if i have to give my final statement regarding this movie i'm going to have to say that i can't help loving it including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical italian horror movies from the late eighties won't be disappointed by this one it has all the typical and always well received clichés like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth the foxy local woman who is said to be a witch a creepy castle a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their hostility to stay away from the infamous lands i would say that la casa dell'orco deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your spouse's face as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story take this movie for what it is and enjoy it </s>

<s> the premise of the story is simple an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred though very little dialog is provided throughout the film the visual narrative told by the camera's eye alone made the film quite engaging the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness which complements the quietness of the characters themselves we can also sense helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder which parallels the silenced child's inability to tell her own story br br true horror lies in feelings of hopelessness helplessness and irrationality this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak br br cleverly the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments the ending is also unexpected and believable reminiscent of japanese horror films such as the ring and dark water or english horror films such as lady in black and the innocents this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try br br by the way if you haven't seen the films i just mentioned above you might want to give them a try as well </s>

<s> flavia la monaca muslmana aka flavia the heretic of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of italian exploitation cinema that to a certain extent follows a somewhat feminist premise though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists set mostly in a convent and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist great performance by the wonderful florinda bolkan flavia the heretic may be referred to as a nunsploitation film however this film differs quite drastically from the typical nunsploitation flicks from the time as it doesn't so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism sadistic lesbian punishments etc personally i saw more similarities to the hexploitation flicks of the time such as mark of the devil even though this one doesn't treat the topic of witch-hunts which focus on the brutal execution of christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period br br italy around 1600 after witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded muslim soldier young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent when her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later falvia's disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church and she joins a band of arabic scavengers br br one thing is for sure flavia the heretic is not for the faint-hearted and neither is it for those who want happy endings director gianfranco mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible especially in its nasty scenes the many torture and execution-scenes are extremely disturbing with skinnings spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film the violence here is never superfluous however after all this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in the film is very well-made with realistic costumes fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by nicola piovani the stunningly beautiful and great florinda bolkan has proved her talent in many great italian cult-productions including lucio fulci's giallo-masterpiece non si sevizia un paperino of 1972 she delivers another great charismatic performance here and i couldn't imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does the film has some minor inconsistencies e g why does the rigid church let bizarre cult-followers into convents in the first place however it is overall amazing how realistic this film is flavia the heretic should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema this is a great exploitation flick overall though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema 7 5 10 </s>

<s> my first impression would be this is beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting grendel and dragons intact making it one thrill ride from start to end written by frederic lanoir and arthur qwak the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around which can either be wastelands or globes of greenery br br the story's a simple one which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy and the resident knights have all but been annihilated enter the king's granddaughter zoe marie drion who gathers lian-chu vincent lindon a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant and his partner-in-arms gwizdo patrick timsit who balances the partnership with his cunning brain lian-chu and gwizdo together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free hence their career in monster-extermination which doesn't exactly pay off br br that's basically the whole gist of it but what makes this film a spectacle is its cg graphics which is solidly rich detailed and an eye-popping marvel to behold it has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action and during those fight sequences there's nary a boring moment photo-realistic moments of non-existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make-belief and it's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three-suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs here's having at you george and i couldn't get enough of the finale battle as well though the usual brick-bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters br br i guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer-animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of pixar's and this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of zodiac the race begins and legend of the sea can learn from  to keep the story effectively simple and let your moving artwork do all the talking definitely highly recommended </s>

<s> well i'd heard from somewhere that ossessione is a precursor to the italian film genre and particular favourite of mine the giallo but actually aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy the two have pretty much no relation in the sixties and seventies italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released they've not done that here but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film the postman always rings twice without giving the book's author james m cain so much as a credit anyway the plot focuses on gino costa a handsome drifter who by chance stumbles upon a café where a woman named giovanna bragana works he soon learns that she's married to giuseppe a big fat annoying man whom giovanna can't stand to have even touching her he wants the pair of them to run away together but she's not so keen on the idea however fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful br br despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on it has to be said that director luchino visconti implements the film noir style well and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics the story is as you would expect extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast visconti drags the film out a little bit too much however and with a running time of almost 135 minutes i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length i almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film but it's not a great film the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters heads there's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been still it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same james m cain classic </s>

<s> the shining is a weird example of adaptation it has very little in common with the source novel written by stephen king yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work this is due to two factors stanley kubrick's masterful direction and jack nicholson's chilly acting br br nicholson plays jack torrance a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place he claims a nice isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family jack his wife wendy shelley duvall and their five-year old son danny danny lloyd the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong he has been told by the cook dick o hallorann scatman crothers that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy the titular shining which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future among other things because of this gift the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny even though he is quite capable of resisting them that is not jack's case however as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break br br the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick though having never worked on this kind of film before knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths king criticized the director for changing most of the story omitting most of the jack danny subplot merely hinted at in the film that led to the book's emotionally strong climax and while his disappointment is valid the omission was actually necessary the novel dealt with redemption albeit in an unconventional way and redemption is a theme kubrick one of the most famous analysts of human decay never had a soft spot for what he is interested in is the mental and subsequently physical unbalance that threatens the characters and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example br br another criticism king raised was about the actors especially nicholson in the writer's opinion his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane thus undermining the rest of the story now it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning but it is equally true that martin sheen king's ideal choice for the role probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholson's from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal here's johnny scene it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 isn't bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoo's nest star as for duvall and lloyd both add terrific support the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens the omen's damien and haley joel osment as cinema's great horror child icons one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart blonde and beautiful and not having much else to do but scream and run but two things ought to be considered a back in 1980 the scream queen cliché wasn't one yet b rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendy's eyes br br irvine welsh the author of trainspotting once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work and he should know given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad the shining proves said point to perfection very little from the novel approximately 5 is included in the film but in kubrick and nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest most original horror pictures of all time which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form </s>
<s> even if you know absolutely nothing about ireland you have to love my left foot and especially daniel day-lewis performance in it he plays cerebral palsy-afflicted christy brown due to this he has spent most of his life ostracized even when trying to warn people about something they just laugh at him the light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part his left foot he uses that appendage to paint and write poetry bringing him to prominence br br daniel day-lewis and director jim sheridan did very well on this collaboration and also on a later collaboration in the name of the father but the boxer was unnecessary my left foot can make you feel many ways sad hopeful or something else but in any case daniel day-lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here a great movie in every sense </s>
<s> the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom simply put the movie was spectacularly average it's not bad but it's really not very good the editing is good the film is well-paced the direction is competent and assured the story is plodding the film is averagely acted by ledger bloom and the normally great watts and rush the accents are impenetrable if you're from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery or as i like to call it orlando bloom by the end of the film i was neither bored nor moved some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie i have to say i so did not care by that point br br really the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range although the oft-present i'm pretty and confused look is prominent so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price other than that just don't see it it's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining </s>
<s> i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual  a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that can't be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesn't kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe i'll eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but i've never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and i'm glad i saw it as a child </s>
<s> hitler the rise of evil is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of world war 2 which makes watching a refreshing experience br br i think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazi-mechanism of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top having arrived there this film ends br br when on top the fuhrer german for leader led his germany to the biggest most devastating war in history of mankind ending six years later in germany's utter defeat as a result germany lost its eastern provinces about 35 of its prewar soil and was forced to accept a 44 year-split of its remaining territory both west and east germany had to be rebuilt from scrap their reputations severely damaged by the many nazi-atrocities inspired by racism br br as i said hitler the rise of evil makes an good watch set in an acceptable thirties-environment with more than competent acting in particular peter o'toole's role as the aged president von hindenburg stands out even adds an extra dimension br br my copy of hitler the rise of evil also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films one is about hitler's personality the second deals with the forgery of the hitler-diaries in 1983 this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists </s>
