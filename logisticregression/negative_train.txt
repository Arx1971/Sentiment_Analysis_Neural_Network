<s> it's difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong because i think the problem begins with the books themselves alexander mccall smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an africa that does not exist he's done for botswana what borat did for kazakhstan  not as successfully but based in as much fact br br once i realised this it ceased to gall me that jill scott an american singer actress is cast as mma ramotswe if she is to represent a land that is not africa how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not african she's not the only american on the cast mma makutsi is played by anika noni rose both women are far far too young for the roles they're playing and far too glamorous both brutally murder the local accents and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting scott's mma ramotswe is bouncy cute and soft rose's mma makutsi is an annoying motor-mouthed bitch br br the result is almost unwatchable the principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of lucian msamati who turns in a decent performance as mr jlb matekoni hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books but i find myself unable to blame msamati for this  he's a shining light in an ocean of suckage the contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script br br to me mccall smith's writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad he refuses to be edited as a result his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific and characters that change name mid-sentence it is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse br br the dialogue is now largely anglicised characters speak of opening up and sensitivity to needs mma ramotswe and mr jlb matekoni flirt openly mma makutsi moans about not having a computer but given her constantly restyled hair makeup and jewellery i'm surprised she doesn't have a macbook in her handbag along with her visa card br br so what are we left with here it's difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly most of the things i like about the original books are apocryphal anyway mccall smith paints a fictional botswana populated with cute non-threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom-nuggets it reads well despite linguistic travesty but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were it just isn't true br br given that it's hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does it remains to be seen whether european and american audiences will even notice however </s>

<s> there are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that br br 1 the people who made this documentary including the director and the producer are serbs or of serbian origin therefore the criteria of neutrality fails for instance they mentioned that the diaspora croats the so called ustase played a huge part in the fall of yugoslavia but they didn't mention that there were equal serbian organizations as well cetniks for you who aren't that familiar with balkan ww2 history the serbian so called cetniks that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped british paratroops during the war well that's only half the truth they were also a fascist monarch group who collaborated with the germans but then switched side when hitler started losing the war it's also ironic that they don't mention the cetnik leader mihajlovic in the documentary a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over bosnia and croatia but they mentioned a certain ante pavelic hm allow me to be just a little suspicious br br 2 most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown and i've studied this war for a long time who is the old british lady she really hasn't made her homework and they are not even presented by name so they could more or less be anybody maybe someone they took from the street who knows br br 3 in the documentary they talk about kosovo and how the serbs have lived there for ages and therefore it should belong to serbia even though they are a minority well when they mention the serbian dominated part of croatia krajina suddenly the serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long fine but what people don't know is that the largest city in krajina knin has great historical importance for the croatian people it was there where one of the most celebrated kings of croatian history zvonimir was crowned and therefore the city has a historical value for croatia the serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later but no the serbs should have krajina and kosovo according to the documentary is that fair to me it looks like double standards of morality from the director plus it is said in the documentary that the croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented because of the fact that croatia had a huge serbian minority br br 4 the film mentions a radical croatian paramilitarian leader called glavas or the muslim radical oric they accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war yes they were radicals but if you want to talk about radicals why not also mention the serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as seselj and arkan the flaws are so many that i just presented a few of them just so that people get an overview of the documentary it looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the serbs because they were afraid that their serbian relatives would slap them or something there aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality but the best so far is the death of yugoslavia where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed e g milosevic jovic bulatovic tudman izetbegovic karadzic etc and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of yugoslavia and the war br br one other thing i saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the us gave support to a country bosnia that had connections with bin laden during the war well first of all all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the bosnian muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity previosly they were called muslim croats they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common their religion and they took help from the mujahedin because no one else would support them they had to fight the 4 th largest army in europe they needed all the help they could get nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war history has shown us that </s>

<s> i rented the dubbed-english version of lensman hoping that since it came from well-known novels it would have some substance while there were hints of substance in the movie it mostly didn't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or it lost a lot in the dubbed version or maybe even the source novels were lightweight but for whatever reason there wasn't much there br br i noticed lots of details that were derivative sloppy poorly dramatized or otherwise deficient some examples the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 star gate scene and the star wars image of hyperspace the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized r2-d2 br br it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars but mercifully since the humor doesn't work gives up on comedy and plays it serious in that sense it's superior to the star wars franchise which started with a clever sense of humor and eventually deteriorated to jar-jar's annoying silliness br br the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field dumping silage onto unharvested crops rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already-harvested rows or into a truck corn maize was pouring out the grain chute but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field br br when it was time for kim's father had to face his fate there wasn't any dramatic weight to the scene that could have been partly the fault of the english-language voice actor but the drawings didn't show much weight either kim's reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing br br similarly when a character named henderson was killed chris showed very little reaction even though they were apparently supposed to have been close henderson's death is no spoiler his name isn't revealed until his death scene she seems to promptly forget him someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case there's at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris br br on several occasions villains fail to accomplish their orders a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths i can't say whether that's lifted from star wars or if that comes from an earlier source  possibly the lensman books br br there's a scene where a space ship crash-lands as it plunges toward the ground parts are break off the ship but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands br br while in most cases chris seems like a competent tough space hero there's a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress someone tough enough to get over henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to shout help it's got me and i can't reach my gun instead of just shrieking br br the character with the most personality almost too much at times is d j bill he sounded like wolfman jack the d j in american graffiti i wonder if he's as well-voiced in the original language br br two planets in the movie exploded the explosions were unimpressive and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars to its credit however the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death star's primary weapon the dialog had a good interesting explanation for the cause many other explosions in the movie did look good just not the planetary explosions br br some of the sound effects are very cheesy as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game some of the images look like primitive video games and some influence from tron is visible too on the other hand the sound effects are often pretty decent although that emphasizes the cheesy-sounding parts the art is good too particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy-looking computer graphics br br finally there's the story if a movie tells a good story it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings but the plot here was pretty lightweight a naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship and acquires a great power he doesn't understand he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful unredeemably evil enemy he makes friends learns about his special power and grows into a young man if he is persistent and virtuous enough he might even defeat the evil enemy details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline but there's very little more than that in this movie br br in the end it's just a kiddie cartoon but then since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children maybe it doesn't need to be anything more than that </s>

<s> no didn't think so well in that case all you have to do is stay far far away from do you wanna know a secret as it's just the umpteenth pointless post scream slasher with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever the plot is extremely ridiculous the characters are insufferably dumb the gore-factor is negligible and the whole thing is just plain boring as you can derive from the title already this film is mainly inspired by i still know what you did last summer as the events take place in a similar setting and the killer's motivations are equally stupid why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like ikwydls is a complete mystery to me anyway at least that film could depend on the precious rack of jennifer love hewitt whereas the girls in this junk are apart from brainless also terribly unattractive one year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend beth morgan her new adulterous lover and four other simple-minded college students go to florida to spend their spring break holiday in a fancy beach house the killer hasn't made a move all year but now he follows the posse to florida and starts butchering them whilst leaving behind the titular message as some sort of business card you really don't need to be a horror-expert in order to quickly figure out which face hides behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and the writers attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing since the plot is so thin most of the film is purely irrelevant padding including the sub plots regarding the incompetent floridian police force and the mysterious fbi inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle the murder inexplicably happen off screen don't you hate it when that happens there isn't even any gratuitous t a to enjoy and you better don't get me started on the quality of the dialogs suffering through crap like this only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 80's slashers is gone for good </s>

<s> warning contains many spoilers br br let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian anderson's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress  which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof br br the premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thought-provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflé it exemplifies why i hate 99 of british cinema it feels too long it's tedious for the most part and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes just when you think there's a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula radcliffe running a marathon with little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot there isn't much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn as for the script i can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees with the average scene reading something along the lines of alice f off adam stares adam runs off into woods alice follows alice adam adam i suspect that word for word the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile adverts what few lines there were didn't have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f-word that would make bridget jones's friend shazza proud there is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic oh that's terrible reaction br br alice isn't the kind of woman who courts sympathy either she's got a great job an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst after the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort-of explain why she is this way to start with she grew up with a tough-as-old-boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so instead of following in his footsteps she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living instead she found a group of stereotypical middle-class toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security entertainment system i e becoming mrs robinson to a wanna-be cockney wide-boy electrician someone pass me a tissue the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson in the hands of a lesser actress she would've been intolerably one-dimensional but ms anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being most notably when she's sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault br br i can't say that adam fared much better either danny dyer played him well as a fish-out-of-water jack the lad but a good performance couldn't save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background br br this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end as for the shock the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin ms anderson has become it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes on a side note only in a british film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on  talk about stiff-upper-lip taken to the extreme if this is the kind of film that the national lottery is donating money to make then i'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week br br saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit i didn't care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion i want that one-and-a-bit hours of my life back please </s>

<s> forbidden siren is based upon the siren 2 playstation 2 so many 2s game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority don't translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfully br br there's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo morimoto and his children daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villagers don't look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing br br naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with what's going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill-placed-out-of-the-norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until it's explained much later it's one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered br br despite it clocking in under 90 minutes  i think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark  it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but it's a classic case of too little too late br br what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience it turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as you'll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel  it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter br br the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit  it's still not worth the time so better to avoid this </s>

<s> pier paolo pasolini or pee-pee-pee as i prefer to call him due to his love of showing male genitals is perhaps the most overrated european marxist director  and they are thick on the ground how anyone can see art in this messy cheap sex-romp concoction is beyond me some of the stories here could have come straight out of a soft-core porn film and i am not even so much referring to the nudity but the simplistic and banal often pointless stories anyone who enjoyed this relatively watchable but dumb oddity should really sink his teeth into the der schulmaedchenreport soft-porn german 70s movie series because that's what decameron looks like to me br br besides the movie is sloppy on nearly all levels from start to finish br br 1 editing an example at 1 hour 15 minutes 45 seconds there is a chasing scene that is put quite clearly in the wrong place it was supposed to be placed about a minute later but i guess that pasolini must have hired boozed-up editors who have little time for the fine details of movie-making pee-pee-pee's fans would probably counter this by saying that it was placed there intentionally  which i very much doubt besides even if that were true that would be even worse because that story gains absolutely nothing by making it harder to follow this isn't exactly eraserhead or one of tarantino's broken-form films br br 2 acting vey sloppy triple pee's fans all 8 of them proudly declare how 3p-o uses real people instead of actors aren't actors people or are they martians sure many actors have sub-par iqs but does that mean we should treat them with contempt other directors have used amateurs and succeeded such as alan parker or de niro so why are ppp's amateurs so utterly awful in his movies the answer is once again appalling sloppiness pasolini is sloppy in everything and that includes trying to get as much out of his toothless amateurs as he can he is a lazy director an imperfectionist if you like the anti-kubrick i suppose pee-pee-pee's principal goal when casting must have been to find as many toothless old people as possible and young men that are to his liking in pasolini's world there is a simple formula lack of teeth strange face realism it's all well and fine to have them toothless but at least try to eke out some at least semi-decent performances out of these inexperienced neo-thespians otherwise you're an amateur yourself  an amateur director in pasolini's case whether 3p-0 wasn't capable of this feat or simply didn't care doesn't change anything who knows maybe he didn't even notice the awful acting br br 3 audio the synchronization if 3p-0 felt that microphones are too much of a hassle when filming a movie then he ought to have at least made a concerted effort in post-production i e getting all these bum actors to say their lines on cue in the studio so that we the viewers wouldn't have to watch mouths move while the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the movie br br 4 lack of concept we have close to a dozen stories which aren't connected in any meaningful way some are anti-church more on that later while some are merely sex yarns i e cheap male sometimes gay fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else the stories and characters are not amusing if at all on an intelligent level but on the basest level 10 year-old kids can laugh here and there is nothing wrong with that but then don't call it exalted intellectual art br br 5 as a result of point 4 there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories that goes without saying pee-pee-pee could have arranged the order in any other way and we would have had the exact same movie this also means that you can feel free to start from the middle then go back to the beginning etc decameron is like a bowl of spaghetti that way when you start eating it you can begin with any thread you want it makes no difference at all br br 6 the pointlessness of the stories resolutions most stories end with a cheap gag joke i e some damn dumb punchline straight out of a porn comic-book whereas some stories don't even have a conclusion they merely end finito at best the stories are watchable semi-anecdotes barely any deeper meaning there  unless you find deep meanings in a porno there is of course nothing easier than looking for and finding meaning where there is an absence of it hence even any hardcore porn film can be philosophized mused over endlessly it's easy and fun try it oh ye 8 ppp fans br br as for the church-bashing some viewers get all excited about his attack on catholicism and what-not in principal that's all well and fine  after all i'm an atheist myself  but what those people ignore is the simple but essential fact that pasolini was a marxist it's like the pot calling the kettle black a marxist criticizing the church for hypocrisy and stupidity where does he get the nerve besides pasolini wasn't an atheist hence his high-and-mighty and self-righteous stance isn't justified after all

<s> there is one really good scene in faat kine the title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened faat kine sprays her in the face the scene works because the act is so unexpected bizarre and rather funny at the same time in that one instance writer director ousmane sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours in the scene he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions for the rest of the movie the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones br br the tone is all over the place it's true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre but i don't think faat kine fits into any genre supposedly it's a drama though there are moments of such broad comedy the aforementioned spraying in the face that it cannot be taken seriously on the other hand the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics sembene has crammed into the picture there is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together unfortunately semebene doesn't find that balance instead one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason leaving two different tones hanging in the wind br br faat kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale the film ends with a big party where all the characters conflicts are resolved only they aren't resolved quickly the scene lasts longer than any other scene going on for probably twenty minutes because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene making for a frustrating viewing experience br br perhaps i am being too hard on faat kine i am not the right audience for it i felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story there are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters however i was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it </s>

<s> an inconvenient truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic republicans it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face namely that we'll all be dead in a few hundred years which is already indisputable but who cares humans are selfish destructive creatures i frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction i'll just call it a natural progression let the apocalypse begin but meanwhile we have to listen to the same brazen slanted politicians who propose another new society well don't be fooled we'll all still be controlled by the wealthy by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place nothing will ever change br br al gore whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle tobacco pig farming which accounts for methane gas traces and who knows what else his wealth is predicated on exploitation greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records i hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party that is all meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling this bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he's lecturing poor people in africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets uses product placed computers in the documentary and yet he thinks everything is a moral issue he's entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines no everything must serve the economy so why is he any different the answer is he is not br br his forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous all this while he's being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes well mr gore why don't you try living like the common people then he is a politician plain and simple he has a career invested in the power structure my question is why doesn't he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications he doesn't do that because it would be unwise for investments stocks and corporations br br al gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary namely to wealthy white people in the audience who clap on cue while showing them graph charts numbers and percentages and speaking in a dreary tone no one without a harvard which the elites control education can make sense out of it but he tells us everything is going to hell no kidding but i think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet namely that it is expendable and a waste dump he never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system its obvious he was spoiled sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing inconsistent dullard in washington whoever made this propaganda as it is in no way different than what the republicans have conceived had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse that is to say someone is going to benefit and it seems the new green politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the new utopian future with new technologies it's the same old story al gore is a believer in the elitist structure he actually believes there is a democracy in the us which i find very naive if we aren't paying wages to the oil companies then we'll be paying them to the wind and solar companies br br i find the speech at the end quite rancid along the lines of something gw bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses gore speaks about people uniting together to defeat communism in the 1990's what it had to do with global warming absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people with that said he didn't understand that communism never existed in the world the systems in europe and ussr were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism no less different than what controls the us interests social ecology was not even mentioned here which is really a travesty if you want to change the world then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed exploitation and violence </s>

<s> i really really wanted to like julian po i think that slater is underrated as an actor and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read so i do not know if what i see as the film's faults originated with the story or were imposed on it by the director screenwriter the premise is wonderful and i loved the voiceover confessional tone the opening narration strikes but then nothing several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide one could argue that he doesn't answer because it's none of their business but julian is the one who under only token pressure blurted out his intentions in public then neither julian nor the director writer despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god's sake seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian's life he says he was a bookkeeper he says his family moved around when he was a child due to his father's job so what there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian's purpose but none of them go anywhere because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet as if he were the ultimate and only sane one among them this might work as an allegory if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive religious wife of the mechanic and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian i can only see the julian character as rendered--as selfish petty and totally condescending sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked contrived film and poor michael parks an actor who once had so much promise is given nothing to work with here </s>

successful lawyer protagonist daughter away at college is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal she has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect gardener who's black but then horror of middle-aged women's horrors another 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts taking over her life br br what this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that gasp really belonged to the divorcee she runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat and backed up the toilet and leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator and hangs her pieces of african artwork in the living room and so on well she may have killed the cat as well yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign the character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane so why did she rent the room  and to horror of horrors a much younger woman br br supposedly this increasingly arrogant natch younger woman has a mania for seizing control and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil and erotically hot looking of course 20 something but there's this problem anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power  and just flirts or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences well there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings it just isn't generally used in quite this sort of way br br the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things and the 20 something has had help the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with utilities thrown in at the fixed price even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something you know the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing finally the 40 something's heroic battle back for the house then begins woopie br br the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro's or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so  although they are generally only this easy against men they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats and sometimes without even hearing his side even when there is a hearing it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats to prove a negative when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the accuser this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true  and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller of course that's not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime br br the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn't taking her medicine even so it makes no sense she isn't after the successful lawyer ex-husband though she does con his help to the ex wife's fury in her quest she's after the house technically to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease this second younger woman is after all that's left after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband the ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling  doesn't matter he still strayed br br the protagonist is good enough looking for her age but her outlook attitude and focus is so small minded frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her well a core group of lifetime fans care i

she climbs the stairs with a knife demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by candlelight secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life there's a struggle

<s> after some internet surfing i found the homefront series on dvd at ioffer com before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the abc news program nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's even with the poor image quality the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine br br to this show's credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case br br as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either curiously the first episode of the show homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended that's like shooting the first episode of gilligan's island showing the castaways being rescued the whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda the show is set in river run ohio near toledo however the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio part of the ensemble cast are dick williams hattie winston and sterling macer jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years we get it we're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for homefront the acting talents of williams winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid br br in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken jenkins is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer br br personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of homefront david assael and james grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage </s>

<s> this movie is a rather odd mix of musical romance drama and crime with a sniff of film-noir to it it's basically one messy heap of different genres of which none really works out like it was supposed to br br this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor he's a former child-star who always used to star in in happy comical and musical productions at the start of his career in this movie he picks a different approach although the musical aspects are still present in the movie but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie i mean mickey rooney as a tough player he's an extremely small boyish looking man he actually was in his 30's already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn't look and feel right he simply isn't convincing in his role br br because the movie mixes so many different genres the story also really feels as a messy one somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot-line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all it just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch lászló kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957 he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality br br let's also not forget that this is a 50's movie but yet it more feels like a 40's one or perhaps even as one from the 30's this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black white generally speaking black white movies from the 50's often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception br br it's a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence it wasn't the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies often simply as himself i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song br br an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney br br 4 10 </s>

<s> i was at first disgusted with director sun-woo jang because i had felt that he cheated me jang had the potential to create a strong deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element i couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best yet this film remained in my mind for days after i viewed it what stayed with me wasn't the story it wasn't the characters nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film but the transition that jang demonstrated between y and j if you watch this film carefully you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship eager to jump into the unknown but not quite certain the next step as they continue to meet exploring new avenues of pleasure they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed jang initially explores the idea that j is the one that in control of the situation then hauntingly the reversal happens when j becomes obsessed with y it is a very small change and due to the graphic content of this film it can easily be missed but it is there it becomes apparently clear near the end when j cannot live with y as their meetings become less frequent and j attempts to become a part of normal society this was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes but alas it was the only element of this film worth viewing br br i will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic because there are human elements at the core of this film as underdeveloped as they are they are there it is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers what happens behind closed doors is never known or so we should believe while the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit director jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other's flesh this is fun at first but again jang's repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting this leads me to the biggest issue that i had with this film jang had a great story with gojitmal but where he failed outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side was that he took scenes repeated them time and again without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters where was jang going with this movie did he want the sex to tell the stories or did he believe the characters would he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves the ending seems almost random at best as jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two absolute unknowns of this film i have to give jang some credit for trying but not much he attempted to create some sub-stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking but they just couldn't congeal well together y's brother and j's wife were those plot points but again due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element these stronger sub-stories became un-rememberable and down-right dull maybe it was just how i viewed this film but outside of the sexual scenes nothing else worked together we knew nothing about j and y and that is why gojitmal failed br br finally i would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us the viewers closer to the emotions being felt by j and y from what i can remember and i am trying to push this film far from my mind i don't remember any musical undertones gojitmal may have been a stronger film if jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more technically this was a poor film obviously an independent film in nature it felt more like director jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature i didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough this was no larry clark production this was sub-par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release br br overall i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy but i felt this film was rushed repetitive and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them the obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived our characters were uneventful our story was underdeveloped and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex to me jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic and it failed miserably this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make br br grade out of </s>

<s> the movie is steeped in religion so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it in my opinion this movie pretends to explore deep issues but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices with little true insight what the people in the movie and therefore the writer failed to see was grace they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful and both the man the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty is just an oversimplification such stereotypes really don't exist for even jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife's pleasure before his own scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh and that no man ever hated his own flesh but he nourishes and cherishes it even if you want to ignore the new testament the writers characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the song of solomon in the old testament and the even the book of proverbs which says rejoice in the wife of thy youth let her breasts satisfy you always how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows and approves of and smiles on the marital union and the enjoyment thereof real men don't ignore the value and needs of their wives those that do deny a very basic teaching of the judeo christian religion god never said those things it's absurd sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true god of abraham it didn't need to be so how sad what sonia desperately needed was truth not tradition in knowing loving and obeying god we love others more before ourselves that is the faith of the god of abraham isaac jacob joseph once for all delivered to the saints bought paid for by jesus christ the righteous but alright ignore all this and abandon ancient holy scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people ghosts that's a good plan i would never recommend this movie partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic but also because it really doesn't offer any valuable insight check out yentl if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society </s>

<s> the cobweb is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all br br the plot is preposterous its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows one old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own and somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children br br the questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real-like lunatic could buy it don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the acting the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors many of them academy award-nominees and winners and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest br br in a short analysis the cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly it just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch </s>

<s> drawing restraint 9 is a kind of movie one either loves or hates fortunately or not i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being thoroughly stuffed with killing whales is bad propaganda aesthetically the movie could have been pleasing especially its first half until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting until then it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda and no single frame is an exception i use the word propaganda because the movie uses basically the old morality play device where good and bad are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone probably it's just me but i find such type of art shallow and preconceived even when it's all about the noble no sarcasm here quest of protecting the environment br br in my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification for the sake of stretching only in my opinion drawing restraint 9 could've been easily fit into 75 minutes but has a torturous length of 2 and 1 4 hours yes there were interesting shots but there were not enough of these to leave 15-minute gaps of nothingness without notice the movie has no standard scenario and there's no evolution of characters but neither it is a documentary it's rather a kind of conceptual installation that's an unusual form for a movie but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here otoh i also believe that the director should've had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minutes br br and yes the music score mostly resembled whale sounds how surprising br br 2 10 </s>

<s> okay i was bored and decided to see this movie but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage then basically that same hour repeated 4 times it consists of 1 gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan 2 flashbacks to the men's wives 3 the approach of the troops marching in a long line 4 men running up hill and shooting usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him 5 defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6 men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs that was the basic movie and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times and every time it did a flashback to the wives it would show the man then his wife and him there were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time other than that the men couldn't kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades i liked the music and there was a lot of action though the action was repetitive overall i probably wouldn't see it again but it wasn't too horrible </s>

<s> dennis hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated american actors of our time and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer most movies hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree but in this movie hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield once i got into the plot of the movie i was hooked but it's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film br br the concept of the film is great  not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt br br that's about all that is good you can say about the film although hopper did try to act like a tough experienced street smart cop i can't help but feel his acting was below par and there wasn't enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case the directing was also terrible  it didn't have the feel of a true film but rather a tv-movie production this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down when the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion the acting was weak predictable and terribly unexciting that's when i knew that 1st of all the action is going to be atrocious br br the angling of the camera was amateurish and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer's little sister had no true distinctive effect if it was supposed to be scary it wasn't everyone's acting was terrible and even for hopper i didn't feel for his character and i just didn't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter br br the final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team once i saw the swat team in action i was thinking finally something good but i was wrong 1st of all the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys that is just impossible 2nd of all apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their hka4 submachine guns with one hand had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun these 4 idiots would've been blown to bits because they weren't even aiming at anything or paying close attention they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward but it just looks like they're not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around 3rd swat team members do not yell out commands such as keep your eyes open watch out for yourselves are we good to go etc in reality they use hand signals or have radios but they're literally yelling at each other  how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you're coming and to top it all off these guys have no plan  apparently they're just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase eventually they end up doing nothing that was the last straw i'm no expert on special forces but basically what i've just outlined is pretty common sense when the audience knows the movie is terrible the action pretty much becomes the life-saver of the movie  when you can't even make an effort to make the action great the movie is lost br br i give 2 stars for the concept but the rest cannot be credited if you want to watch a crime thriller don't bother with this one there's plenty of crime in the movie  but it has the lack of thrill </s>

<s> why every horror director wants to imitate the exorcist is a complete riddle to me as william friedkin's classic is a very overrated film and in my opinion not all that tense or shocking and yet here's another clean rip-off a spanish one this time that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family paul naschy who i must admit looks quite hot here plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend at first the priest doesn't believe it but when john's body is discovered with its neck twisted leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable exorcism is not only very unoriginal it's also an insufferably boring film here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments albeit very stupid and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money this is just an awful film end of story other european the excorcist rip-offs are the antichrist and beyond the door and they suck as well </s>

<s> this is easily the most disappointing least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre which by the way are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home rather than being exploitation or demeaning these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era well not bucktown br br in this story duke returns to bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother he quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses duke resists and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police unfortunately he does so by calling in a posse of his friends these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with duke on jobs in the past and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood and literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it ignorance is not a justification for murder and it would have been much more entertaining to see the cracker police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street while revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre it is a far cry from seeing pam grier track down the thugs who off'ed her family cuss them out give them a jujitsu ass-kickin and set their fro on fire that has art and a reason for existing and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back of course in this bizarre tale she is playing a woman completely under the man's thumb afraid of the crackers who run her town and oppress her people indeed her advice to duke is run man they gonna kill you br br following the sickening and gratuitous violence we are expected to believe that the town's mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of duke and his friends congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor as opposed to say calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody duke's posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree they immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their cracker police predecessors to quote the mayor they are ten times worse than what we had before now duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of bucktown from corrupt protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets unfortunately duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force i wouldn't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point i suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way duke has to outsmart the new police goons but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the cracker police duke is a pig br br finally when everyone in town but duke aretha and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin in the street our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values they don't duke is merely a murderous thug and aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice if you are interested in this genre of film by all means i highly recommend them see coffy foxy brown truck turner blacula sheba baby but if in the process you should run across this dvd throw it as far away as you possibly can drop it like it's hot it should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste there is no single film in the entire blacksploitation era that is not dramatically more entertaining satisfying and populated with more sympathetic and admirable characters than this piece of slime obviously written by and targeted at some hormonally imbalanced high school sophomores </s>

<s> i was really looking forward to watching this being that i love danny dyer and i think gillian anderson is a gifted actress the beginning was interesting i liked the relationship between the two stars it then quickly jumps to the main plot which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and dyer gets beaten extremely bad while anderson gets raped they then decide to go for some revenge sounds good right well it's not the story gets boring and side-tracked and certain things get really weird i won't give out any details but things happen that i for one have no desire to see i like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt and i really wanted to like this one it just didn't work out i give it a 3 out of 10 mainly for the acting </s>
<s> i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10  because the stories are open-ended and left unexplained and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way plus scenes of a decaying corpse br br neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner br br the film's plot such as it is concerns three loosely interconnecting stories none of which conclude satisfactorily br br the bounty hunter played by bruce dern is the character that connects all three vignettes br br first we have dylan mcdermott looking darn fine as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl played by helen hunt br br then we have one of the hemingway girls not sure which one playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman an attractive redhead whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long br br the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension </s>
<s> i really cant think of anything good to say about this film not a single thing the script is a nightmare the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference you'd think they would at least get a technical advisor the performances were bad by most of the cast although i dont really blame them the material really stinks the editing was equally bad i'll just stop now its all bad 2 10 </s>
<s> now i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it he is an excellent actor brilliant in everything except this movie and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was and didn't bother with a good performance this movie is a unintentional-comedy some of the lines just crack me up and them there are some lines that make no sense and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot oh btw the plot is bad but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans or fans of any of the other actors because the plot is pathetic </s>
<s> this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids the message of the film about dealing with loss is subverted by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits team rocket provide some amusement but they're not really part of the small plot so they don't appear very often </s>
